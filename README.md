===================
I'm using this site as my online home.

My goals:
* consolidate my online content
* make this my start page
* inventory my work here

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/projectname`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll --server`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.
