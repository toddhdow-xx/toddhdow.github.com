Order:
1. What is advent?
* expectant waiting for Christ.
* it originated as a forty day fast in preparation for Christmas.
* it is meant to be a time of reflection, expectation and preparation for the feast of Christmas and the second coming of Christ.
* as early as the 5th century, it was referred to as St. Martin's Lent.
* by the 9th century, the duration of Advent was reduced to four weeks.
* the focus for each week can vary, but traditionally, the order is as follows:
** First Sunday = reflection on old testament patriarchs. Some call it a reflection of hope.
** Second Sunday = focus on Christ's birth in a manger and other prophecies.
** Third Sunday = Gaudete Sunday or a time to rejoice about the coming of the Lord.
** Fourth Sunday = announcement of Christ's birth.
Traditionally, the Advent season has involved fasting and refraining from dancing and similar festivities. This tradition has been relaxed over time. Eastern Orthodox and some others still hold the tradition of fasting for 40 days before Christmas.

For today, we will discuss two arrivals of Christ:
* John the Baptist predicted the arrival of "someone who is greater than I am"
* Peter's reminder that the Lord is returning.

And we will reflect on these in the context of discussing right relationship with God, others and ourselves.

We long for comfort and peace. The Bible tells us that:
* Christ came
* Christ died for us
* Christ rose again
* Christ will return



Main topics covered:
I'm going to share a very personal story with you today. I have been hesitant to share this story publicly, but I think that a higher power wants me to share this story. And, I think a higher power wants me to do something about the situation that I'll be sharing with you today. Or, maybe the whole thing is just a fluke. But, in this case, I don't think that chance is involved.

For those that don't know, pastors have numerous tools to help with sermon topic selection. Back in October, Phil and I discussed the best date for me to preach and we decided that today would work best. Phil informed me that we would be using the Advent worship materials provided by the Mennonite church. The materials for Dec 7 (today) offered some suggestions for sermon direction. I was free to choose my sermon topic, but it would be ideal if I could follow the spirit of this suggested sermon topic if possible.

Well... as soon as I read the sermon topic, I knew that I would be sharing this story. So... here goes.

This is my sister:

This is my situation:

different worldviews
* military families put their lives on the line daily.
* they actively demonstrate their belief in protecting people from harm.
* Would I act differently if I believed in a specific cause?
* would I defend my family from an intruder? Absolutely.
* as a pacifist, my commitment is cheap. I use words. But I have no skin in the game. Nor am I confident that I would actually demonstrate my convictions if my life were on the line.

different beliefs
* Christians are held to a different standard.
* don't be self-righteous.
* don't judge.
* don't swear or drink.
* you don't know how to have fun.
* don't give up on other people.
* Christians are seen as hypocrites if they deviate from the "perfect" standard set out for them.

* I've been told and I feel like I'm not measuring up.

What to do...?

Before we continue, let's take a step back and reflect on what is coming up. Christmas is coming. Jesus is coming. Our saviour. Our model. Our Christ.

DEFINE CHRIST.

In Mark, John the Baptist is living his faith. He is baptizing people in the Jordan. He is talking about the one that is coming soon - the one that he is not worthy even to untie the straps of his sandals. He tells us of the one that will baptize us with the Holy Spirit.

Why doesn't Mark have a birth story? Is it relevant? Answer this question here.

With Christmas approaching, we are preparing for the arrival of our greatest gift - the birth of Jesus.

How do we celebrate Christmas? We celebrate our ultimate gift with the most important people in our lives: our family and friends.

I'm in quite a bind. I have serious conflict in my family. I can't possibly expect to be in the same room with my wife, my sister, my mom, my brother-in-law and a bunch of spectators, waiting for things to blow up. It just won't work.

But Peter is right: while I am waiting for Christ to return, I need to make every effort to be found living a peaceful life that are pure and blameless in his sight.

Jesus has provided us with his instruction: Love God and love your neighbour. This is his instruction for us.

We are instructed to demonstrate love in all that we do, regardless of what is done to us. Jesus and his disciples demonstrated this in the face of persecution. Jesus forgave his executioners.

How many of you have conflict with someone around you? A family member, a spouse, an ex, a friend, a co-worker or anyone else that you interact with. It's hard, isn't it. You could both be right, you could both be wrong, but nobody wants to admit it. So you hold onto your anger, your frustration and your judgment.

And hate grows. And it is evil. It hurts you. It hurts the one you are in conflict with. It hurts those around you. It just hurts.

I am hurt. I am angry. I am self-righteous. I have hate. And I feel evil for it. And I hate the way that makes me feel.

But mostly, I have loss.
* lost family
* lost community
* lost holidays together

I don't know how this story will end. It is a sad story. It is a real story. And it is a story with plenty of hurt. At first glance, it is a story of a broken relationship between siblings. But when we look at it, it is much more. It is a haunting story of a lack of right relationship between family. It is a haunting story of a lack of right rleationship with ourselves. And it is also a haunting story of a lack of right relationship with God.


I have been searching for a solution. On matters of conscience, I sometimes look to Dietrich Bonhoeffer for guidance. Bonhoeffer died in contradiction to his beliefs. Bonhoeffer was a pacifist who held that the beatitudes were instructive tools for life. Ultimately, Bonhoeffer lost his life because of an action that ran counter to his beliefs: he was captured and executed as a conspirator in a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

Bonhoeffer said, "The right way to requite evil, according to Jesus, is not to resist it."
Further, "The only way to overcome evil is to let it run itself to a standstill because it does not find the resistance it is looking for."

I actively resist. But should I? Maybe not...

In the meantime,
I look to the holidays and the potential to welcome Christ into the world.
I look to the holidays where we welcome Christ and his unconditional love.
I look to the holidays and wish for the peace of Christ.
