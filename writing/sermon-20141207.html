Sermon title: Right relationship with God, others & ourselves

Oh, that you would reveal your peace:

Focus statement:
In a disturbed and noisy world we hear God say, "Comfort, comfort my people."

Texts:
Mark 1:1-8
2 Peter 3:8-15a

Additional info (Lorraine, please share this with the worship leader in case they need assistance with music):
My sermon will be discussing broken family relationships and the importance of making them right.
I will highlight some current world conflicts (Ferguson, the war on terror, ISIS, etc.).
My main focus will be a serious rift between me and my sister and how we are not in right relationship. I will be reflecting on my responsibilities as a Christian to heal this rift and the challenges involved with doing so.


Mark 1:1-8:
This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God. It began just as the prophet Isaiah had written:
"Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way.
He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord's coming!
Clear the road for him!'"
This messenger was John the Baptist. He was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of thier sins and turned to God to be forgiven. All of Judea, including all the people of Jerusalem, went out to see and hear John. And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the jordan River. His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.
John announced: "Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am - so much greater that I'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit!"

2 Peter 3:8;15a:
But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day. The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent. But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elemenbts themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment.
Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live, looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames. But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness.
And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.
And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved.


Call to worship:
Come, let us worship in faith the God who is here and desires our worship.
Redeeming God, work in our hearts so that we, your people, would share in your peace.

Confession:
Today, in this safe but dark and holy place we become aware of your presence, God.
We look inward at wrongs we have done against others in our family, our neighbourhood, our workplaces, and our churches. Sometimes we were paying back, sometimes just being mean, and sometimes we didn't realize the wrong we were doing.
We ask you, Lord, to take our sin, including our inward secrets, and make us new.

Basic outline:
Look at:
Ferguson, Missouri
The War on Terror
Your fight with your best friend
The family feud that refuses to go away.

What is happening in each of these situations?
* Revenge
Revenge is masquerading as justice.

I don't like how I was treated.
Those people are going to pay.
I will never forgive that person.
Our family will never heal.

Is this what Jesus taught us? Are these the words of Christians?

Sure they are:
George Bush on the war on terror
An eye for an eye

Are they Christ-like?
Hardly.

What can we do about it?
Adjust our perspective.



Christmas is a time of friction in my family. Actually, most family holidays are stressful in my family. It wasn't always like this.

I have a confession to make. I don't think I should be up here. I don't feel like I measure up.



Are we in right relationship with God?
Can we be in right relationship with God when we are not in right relationship with other people?
Examples:
Our country supports wars where we kill innocent civilians in a distant land.
CAR - terrible atrocities being committed daily.
My sister Stacey.

I don't measure up. I know that I should be doing more, but I don't.
I am weak.

Have you ever been accused of the following because you go to church?
* you are too judgmental
* you are not accepting
* you preach to others
* you don't like to have fun

Bonhoeffer:
pg 141: "The rght way to requite evil, according to Jesus, is not to resist it."
"The only way to overcome evil is to let it run itself to a standstill because it does not find the resistance it is looking for."
* discuss how this is a continuation of being meek, as described in the beatitudes.




Sermon seeds:
The prophetic calls for God to intervene become prescriptive on this Sunday. Both Isaiah and the psalmist cry to God to bring God's peace to the world. The opening line of Mark's gospel tells us God has heard the people's prayers and has indeed responded. Just as boldly as Isaiah's words announce the end of the exile, so John the Baptist boldly announces the coming of the Messiah of God.

People were not expecting this announcement to come in combination with a call to repentance. They were waiting for a figure on a white horse, for companies of soldiers that would lead the people of Israel in the defeat of Rom. Instead, they are confronted by a man covered in camel's hair who invites people to identify with their ancestors' walk to freedom, to walk through the waters. This walk in the waters combines repentance with deliverance; it is a walk that is necessary for entering God's new kingdom. It leads not to an overthrow of the Roman oppressors but to a kingdom of peace, in a deeper sense of the word.

As Christmas Day approaches, many people find comfort and meaning in rituals they celebrate every year. But those rituals can lose their sparkle over time. Growth and newness can occur when familiar rituals are altered by actions that align with God's intentions, which lead to the peace of Christ ruling our hearts and lives. Adjust your Christmas rituals by inviting new people to celebrate Christmas with you, initiating a gathering in your neighbourhood, or by Christmas caroling for those who are in extended care. These changes may be unnerving, but they also hold the promise of renewal as we extend the peace of Christ to others.

Hi Todd,
 
This is to confirm your invitation to preach during Advent.
 
Worship committee thought the second Sunday, Dec. 7 would be good for you to take if you are willing and able.
 
We will be following the Advent worship materials produced by the Mennonite church.
 
I have attached the materials for Dec. 7.  These include suggestions for the sermon direction.
 
What we would ask in a sermon is that you follow the theme for that Sunday.  There are four scripture texts, and you can use which ever one or ones you want.
 
Thanks for considering,
 
Phil B
