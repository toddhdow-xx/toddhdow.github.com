Oh, that you would reveal your peace:

Focus statement:
In a disturbed and noisy world we hear God say, "Comfort, comfort my people."

Texts:
Isaiah 40:1-11
Mark 1:1-8

Call to worship:
Come, let us worship in faith the God who is here and desires our worship.
Redeeming God, work in our hearts so that we, your people, would share in your peace.

Confession:
Today, in this safe but dark and holy place we become aware of your presence, God.
We look inward at wrongs we have done against others in our family, our neighbourhood, our workplaces, and our churches. Sometimes we were paying back, sometimes just being mean, and sometimes we didn't realize the wrong we were doing.
We ask you, Lord, to take our sin, including our inward secrets, and make us new.

Basic outline:
Look at:
Ferguson, Missouri
The War on Terror
Your fight with your best friend
The family feud that refuses to go away.

What is happening in each of these situations?
* Revenge
Revenge is masquerading as justice.

I don't like how I was treated.
Those people are going to pay.
I will never forgive that person.
Our family will never heal.

Is this what Jesus taught us? Are these the words of Christians?

Sure they are:
George Bush on the war on terror
An eye for an eye

Are they Christ-like?
Hardly.

What can we do about it?
Adjust our perspective.



Christmas is a time of friction in my family. Actually, most family holidays are stressful in my family. It wasn't always like this.

I have a confession to make. I don't think I should be up here. I don't feel like I measure up.



Are we in right relationship with God?
Can we be in right relationship with God when we are not in right relationship with other people?
Examples:
Our country supports wars where we kill innocent civilians in a distant land.
CAR - terrible atrocities being committed daily.
My sister Stacey.

I don't measure up. I know that I should be doing more, but I don't.
I am weak.

Have you ever been accused of the following because you go to church?
* you are too judgmental
* you are not accepting
* you preach to others
* you don't like to have fun

Bonhoeffer:
pg 141: "The rght way to requite evil, according to Jesus, is not to resist it."
"The only way to overcome evil is to let it run itself to a standstill because it does not find the resistance it is looking for."
* discuss how this is a continuation of being meek, as described in the beatitudes.




Sermon seeds:
The prophetic calls for God to intervene become prescriptive on this Sunday. Both Isaiah and the psalmist cry to God to bring God's peace to the world. The opening line of Mark's gospel tells us God has heard the people's prayers and has indeed responded. Just as boldly as Isaiah's words announce the end of the exile, so John the Baptist boldly announces the coming of the Messiah of God.

People were not expecting this announcement to come in combination with a call to repentance. They were waiting for a figure on a white horse, for companies of soldiers that would lead the people of Israel in the defeat of Rom. Instead, they are confronted by a man covered in camel's hair who invites people to identify with their ancestors' walk to freedom, to walk through the waters. This walk in the waters combines repentance with deliverance; it is a walk that is necessary for entering God's new kingdom. It leads not to an overthrow of the Roman oppressors but to a kingdom of peace, in a deeper sense of the word.

As Christmas Day approaches, many people find comfort and meaning in rituals they celebrate every year. But those rituals can lose their sparkle over time. Growth and newness can occur when familiar rituals are altered by actions that align with God's intentions, which lead to the peace of Christ ruling our hearts and lives. Adjust your Christmas rituals by inviting new people to celebrate Christmas with you, initiating a gathering in your neighbourhood, or by Christmas caroling for those who are in extended care. These changes may be unnerving, but they also hold the promise of renewal as we extend the peace of Christ to others.

Hi Todd,
 
This is to confirm your invitation to preach during Advent.
 
Worship committee thought the second Sunday, Dec. 7 would be good for you to take if you are willing and able.
 
We will be following the Advent worship materials produced by the Mennonite church.
 
I have attached the materials for Dec. 7.  These include suggestions for the sermon direction.
 
What we would ask in a sermon is that you follow the theme for that Sunday.  There are four scripture texts, and you can use which ever one or ones you want.
 
Thanks for considering,
 
Phil B
