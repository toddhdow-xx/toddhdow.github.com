Sermon title: Right relationship with God, others & ourselves

Oh, that you would reveal your peace:

Focus statement:
In a disturbed and noisy world we hear God say, "Comfort, comfort my people."

Texts:
Mark 1:1-8
2 Peter 3:8-15a

Mark 1:1-8:
This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God. It began just as the prophet Isaiah had written:
"Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way.
He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord's coming!
Clear the road for him!'"
This messenger was John the Baptist. He was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of thier sins and turned to God to be forgiven. All of Judea, including all the people of Jerusalem, went out to see and hear John. And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the jordan River. His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.
John announced: "Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am - so much greater that I'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit!"

2 Peter 3:8;15a:
But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day. The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent. But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elemenbts themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment.
Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live, looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames. But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness.
And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.
And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved.

Introduction:
I'm going to share a very personal story with you today. I have been hesitant to share this story publicly, but today's sermon topic feels too coincidental to me to be by chance. I'm beginning to think that a higher power wants me to share this story. And, I'm beginning to think that a higher power wants me to do something about this situation. Or, maybe the whole thing is just a fluke. I'll let you be the judge.

For those that don't know, pastors have numerous tools to help with sermon topic selection. Back in October, Phil and I discussed the best date for me to preach and we decided that today, December 7, would work best. Phil informed me that we would be using the Advent materials provided by the Mennonite church.

To frame this discussion, it's good to have an understanding of what Advent is.
Advent is best described as a period of time where there is expectant waiting for Christ. Advent originated as a forty day fast in preparation for Christmas. It is meant to be a time of reflection, expectation and preparation for the feast of Christmas and the second coming of Christ.

As early as the 5th century, it was referred to as St. Martin's Lent. By the 9th century, the duration of Advent was reduced from forty days to four weeks.

The focus for each week can vary, but traditionally, the order is as follows:
* First Sunday = reflection on old testament patriarchs. Some call it a reflection of hope.
* Second Sunday = focus on Christ's birth in a manger and other prophecies.
* Third Sunday = Gaudete Sunday or a time to rejoice about the coming of the Lord.
* Fourth Sunday = announcement of Christ's birth.
Traditionally, the Advent season has involved fasting and refraining from dancing and similar festivities. These traditions have been relaxed over time. Eastern Orthodox and some others still hold the tradition of fasting for 40 days before Christmas.

The worship materials for the second week of Advent (which is today) offered some suggestions for sermon direction. I was free to choose my sermon topic, but it would be ideal if I could follow the spirit of this suggested sermon topic if possible.

Well... as soon as I read the sermon topic, I knew that I would be sharing this story.

The topic for today is: Oh, that you would reveal your peace.
And the focus statement for today is: In a disturbed and noisy world we hear God say, Comfort, comfort my people."

So... here goes.

This is my sister:
* picture overhead

My sister lives on a hobby farm just outside of Ottawa with her husband, her two step-sons and their critters. They have two dogs, sheep, chickens and I think she has llamas as well. Her husband is in the military and she works for the government. They don't have a lot of extended family in Ottawa.

I live here in Beamsville with my family, with my mom just around the corner in Hamilton and my plenty of extended family close by. Oh, and I am a pacifist.

Last Remembrance Day (2013), my sister's husband was leaving for a long deployment to the middle east. This is a regular challenge for military families and they have been through this a few times since they have been married. This is challenging for Stacey as she is pretty isolated when he is away for long periods of time.

My wife Julie posted a button on Facebook that said "to remember is to work for peace" and it had a picture of the MCC dove on it.

My sister, who knew of, and disagreed with, our pacifist leanings put a comment on Julie's wall pushing her pro-war mentality in reference to the button. Julie and I discussed how best to respond, and I told Julie to just delete my sister's comment as neither of us wanted this to escalate into a public comfrontation on Facebook. Julie deleted it. About a 1/2 hour later, my sister reposted her comment. Again, I told Julie to delete it and she did. Then we went to bed. It was late.

The next morning, I checked my email and my sister had written to me, my mom and Stacey's husband, criticizing our decision to delete her comment the night prior. She said a bunch of additional things, none of which need to be shared. I wrote back. She wrote back. Things got worse. Retaliation, hurt feelings, insults and irrepairable comments were made.

Now we don't talk. It has been over a year now and we have not seen or talked to one another. Growing up, we were best friends. I was her older brother. I protected her. I took care of her. I paved the way for her. Now, we are at an impasse. And it makes it uncomfortable for others as well. My wife, my mom, cousins, aunts and uncles are all faced with an uncomfortable balance due to our conflict. It's very hard.

Now, this begs the question, what does a fight between my sister & I have to do with today's topic?

For today, on the second Advent, we discuss two arrivals of Christ:
First, in the book of Mark, John the Baptist predicted the arrival of "someone who is greater than I am"
And second, in 2 Peter, Peter reminds us that the Lord is returning.

We're going to look at how these scriptures reflect on our current situations and on our desire for comfort and peace in our own lives.

John the Baptist lived under Roman occupation. The Romans tolerated the Jewish people and the multitude of pagan religions that were spread throughout the occupied territories. The people were oppressed. They lived under constant fear of persecution, punishment and death.

People were taxed, relocated, imprisoned and put to death in the name of peace.
This period of time was called The Pax Romana.

In all of this, John the Baptist showed up and started baptizing people, telling them that they need to repent and they will be cleansed of their sins. And he announced that one greater than he is coming. "So much greater that I'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals."

Think about this for a minute:
In the midst of the Jewish leadership, a wilderness man arrived preaching of repentence and forgiveness of sins. This is a fringe movement that John the Baptist was starting. He was anti-establishment. John was a prophet. He was different. And he said that one greater than he was coming.

John the Baptist was killed for his influence.
He was imprisoned for criticizing Herod, the local Roman King, of moral improprieties. John reproved Herod for divorcing his wife and unlawfully taking the wife of his brother. A short time later, his new daughter-in-law danced before Herod and his guests. Herod was so pleased that he offered her anything she desired, up to half of his kingdom. Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." The King was afraid to kill John, as John had many followers and he didn't want him to become a martyr. But he conceded and beheaded John.

Let me paraphrase this a bit: John the Baptist criticized the moral decision making of a state leader and was killed as a result.

Does this sound at all familiar?

Do these people sound familiar:
Julian Assange:
* Publisher of WikiLeaks, which is a leader in the current whistleblower movement.
* He is currently living under political asylum in Ecuador.
* The US has not stated its intentions regarding Assange but it is suspected that they want to extradite him once he is under arrest in a US-friendly nation.

Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning
* currently serving a 35 year prison sentence for violating the Espionage Act.
* He leaked documents to WikiLeaks whih showed various airstrikes, diplomatic cables and war logs.
* The most famous document was a Baghdad airstrike that showed two American helicopters firing on a group of men who were later found to be Reuters reporters and a family that had stopped to assist the reporters.
* He has been referred to as both a traitor and as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man.

John Kiriakou
* He is the first official within the US government to confirm the use of waterboarding of al-Queda prisoners as an interrogation technique, which he desribed as torture.
* He is currently serving a 30 month sentence for disclosing this information.

Edward Snowden
* Former US CIA employee who leaked a huge amount of classified information pertaining to US surveillance programs.
* His influence has greatly heightened the privacy debate within the western world.
* He is currently sought by US authorities, who have charged him with two charges of violating the Espionage Act and theft of government property, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
* He is currently living in temporary asylum in Russia.

I am not trying to compare these guys to Christian founders. But the similarities and struggles do look fairly similar.

But there's more:
Ferguson
NY City
Privacy
WikiLeaks
Israel
Palestine
Afghanistan
US torture report

As much as we think things have changed, they really haven't. Some of us live more comfortably, but really, the social concerns are no different for much of the world.

Some call our time the Pax Americana. The period of American peace. Of Western peace.

The New Testament contains two letters from Peter to Christians everywhere. They are addressed to a Christian audience that is scattered and being persecuted. Scholars suggest that these letters were written anywhere from 60 to 160 AD. So, this is anywhere from 30 to over 100 years after Jesus' crucifixion and the subsequent crackdown on his disciples and followers.

Peter's letters are meant to remind Christians to have faith and to hold onto the memory and the teaching of Jesus.

In 2 Peter, Peter tells us that Jesus will return. His timetable isn't clear, but we are reminded that time is different for God. A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day. The day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief.

And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.
And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved.

Peter tells us to make every effort to be found living peaceful lives. He urges his audience to get your affairs in order and to be ready, as God could come at any time. He says that we should use our time to prepare ourselves and to have peaceful lives so that we are ready to be saved when he arrives.

At this very point in my preparation something happened - the timing couldn't have been better:
Yesterday, as I was finishing this sermon, I was sitting upstairs typing away, music playing on my ipod. Over the music, I could hear my kids fighting downstairs and Julie mediating in the dispute. It was funny, because this interruption occurred just as I was typing the words "peaceful lives".

And it is quite fitting: as I heard this struggle, I wished that my children could be peaceful towards each other. I wished that they would stop fighting. I wished that they would realize the gift that they had between them. The gift of siblings, family and love.

And my sermon came full circle.

My sister and I no longer talk. Because of a conflict that is bigger than either of us, but yet, it is a conflict that envelops all of us.

But Peter is right: while I am waiting for Christ to return, I need to make every effort to be found living a peaceful life that are pure and blameless in his sight.

Jesus has provided us with his instruction: Love God and love your neighbour. This is his instruction for us.

We are instructed to demonstrate love in all that we do, regardless of what is done to us. Jesus and his disciples demonstrated this in the face of persecution. Jesus forgave his executioners.

How many of you have conflict with someone around you? A family member, a spouse, an ex, a friend, a co-worker or anyone else that you interact with. It's hard, isn't it. You could both be right, you could both be wrong, but nobody wants to admit it. So you hold onto your anger, your frustration and your judgment.

And hate grows. And it is evil. It hurts you. It hurts the one you are in conflict with. It hurts those around you. It just hurts.

I am hurt. I am angry. I am self-righteous. I have hate. And I feel evil because of it. And I hate the way that makes me feel.

But mostly, I have loss.
* lost family
* lost community
* lost holidays together
* lost time in peace

I don't know how this story will end. It is a sad story. It is a real story. And it is a story with plenty of hurt. At first glance, it is a story of a broken relationship between siblings. But when we look at it, it is much more. It is a haunting story of a lack of right relationship between family. It is a haunting story of a lack of right rleationship with ourselves. And it is also a haunting story of a lack of right relationship with God.


I have been searching for a solution. On matters of conscience, I sometimes look to Dietrich Bonhoeffer for guidance. Bonhoeffer died in contradiction to his beliefs. Bonhoeffer was a pacifist who held that the beatitudes were instructive tools for life. Ultimately, Bonhoeffer lost his life because of an action that ran counter to his beliefs: he was captured and executed as a conspirator in a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

Bonhoeffer said, "The right way to requite evil, according to Jesus, is not to resist it."
Further, "The only way to overcome evil is to let it run itself to a standstill because it does not find the resistance it is looking for."

I actively resist. But should I?

Maybe we should use the holidays to:
* build new traditions
* repair damaged relationships
* remind us to be kind to our fellow people
* reach out to others around us
* build neighbourhood traditions of caroling or outreach

I don't know about you but for me, this year:
I look to the holidays and the potential to welcome Christ into the world.
I look to the holidays where we welcome Christ and his unconditional love.
I look to the holidays as a kindle to bridge conflict.
I look to the holidays and wish for the peace of Christ.
