Sermon title: Right relationship with God, others & ourselves

Oh, that you would reveal your peace:

Focus statement:
In a disturbed and noisy world we hear God say, "Comfort, comfort my people."

Texts:
Mark 1:1-8
2 Peter 3:8-15a

I'm going to share a very personal story with you today. I have been hesitant to share this story publicly, but I think that a higher power wants me to share this story. And, I think a higher power wants me to do something about the situation that I'll be sharing with you today. Or, maybe the whole thing is just a fluke. But, in this case, I don't think that chance is involved.

For those that don't know, pastors have numerous tools to help with sermon topic selection. Back in October, Phil and I discussed the best date for me to preach and we decided that today would work best. Phil informed me that we would be using the Advent materials provided by the Mennonite church.

To frame this discussion, it's good to have an understanding of what Advent is.
3. What is Advent
* expectant waiting for Christ.
* it originated as a forty day fast in preparation for Christmas.
* it is meant to be a time of reflection, expectation and preparation for the feast of Christmas and the second coming of Christ.
* as early as the 5th century, it was referred to as St. Martin's Lent.
* by the 9th century, the duration of Advent was reduced to four weeks.
* the focus for each week can vary, but traditionally, the order is as follows:
** First Sunday = reflection on old testament patriarchs. Some call it a reflection of hope.
** Second Sunday = focus on Christ's birth in a manger and other prophecies.
** Third Sunday = Gaudete Sunday or a time to rejoice about the coming of the Lord.
** Fourth Sunday = announcement of Christ's birth.
Traditionally, the Advent season has involved fasting and refraining from dancing and similar festivities. This tradition has been relaxed over time. Eastern Orthodox and some others still hold the tradition of fasting for 40 days before Christmas.


The worship materials for Dec 7 (today) offered some suggestions for sermon direction. I was free to choose my sermon topic, but it would be ideal if I could follow the spirit of this suggested sermon topic if possible.

Well... as soon as I read the sermon topic, I knew that I would be sharing this story. So... here goes.

This is my sister:
* picture overhead

This is her situation:
* isolated
* husband overseas
* lonely
* certain of her worldview pertaining to war

This is my situation:
* surrounded by family
* judgmental older brother
* happily married
* comfortable in life
* certain of my worldview pertaining to pacifism

Enter Remembrance Day 2013:
* the button
* the message
* my response
* the explosion

Broken relationships:
* my wife
* my mom
* my sister
* other family are caught in the middle

Christmas 2013
Birthdays throughout 2014
Christmas 2014
The future?


Now, this begs the question, what does my sister & I have to do with today's topic?

For today, we will discuss two arrivals of Christ:
* John the Baptist predicted the arrival of "someone who is greater than I am"
* Peter's reminder that the Lord is returning.


John the Baptist lived under Roman occupation. The Romans tolerated the Jewish people and the multitude of pagan religions that were spread throughout the occupied territories.
The people were oppressed.
They lived under constant fear of:
* persecution
* punishment
* death

People were taxed, relocated, imprisoned and put to death in the name of peace.
This period of time was called The Pax Romana.

Does any of this sound familiar?
Ferguson
NY City

WikiLeaks
Israel
Palestine
Afghanistan
US torture report

As much as we think things have changed, they really haven't. Some of us live more comfortably, but really, the social concerns are no different for much of the world.

In all of this, John the Baptist showed up and starts baptizing people, telling them that they need to repent and they will be cleansed of their sins. And he announces that one greater than he is coming. So much greater that I'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals.

Think about this for a minute:
In the midst of the Jewish leadership, a man wilderness man arrived preaching of repentence and forgiveness of sins. This is a fringe movement that John the Baptist was starting. He was anti-establishment. John was a prophet. He was different. And he said that one greater than he was coming.

John the Baptist was killed for his influence.
He was imprisoned for criticizing Herod, the local Roman King, of moral improprieties. John reproved Herod for divorcing his wife and unlawfully taking the wife of his brother. A short time later, his new daughter-in-law danced before Herod and his guests. Herod was so pleased that he offered her anything she desired, up to half of his kingdom. Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." The King was afraid to kill John, as he had many followers and he didn't want him to become a martyr. But he conceded and beheaded John.

Does this sound at all familiar?
Julian Assange:
* Publisher of WikiLeaks
* He is currently living under political asylum in Ecuador
* The US has not stated its intentions regarding Assange but it is suspected that they want to extradite him once he is under arrest in a US-friendly nation.

Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning
* currently serving a 35 year prison sentence for violating the Espionage Act
* He leaked documents to WikiLeaks whih showed various airstrikes, diplomatic cables and war logs.
* The most famous document was a Baghdad airstrike that showed two American helicopters firing on a group of men who were later found to be Reuters reporters and a family that had stopped to assist the reporters.
* He has been referred to as both a traitor and as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man.

John Kiriakou
* He is the first official within the US government to confirm the use of waterboarding of al-Queda prisoners as an interrogation technique, which he desribed as torture.
* He is currently serving a 30 month sentence for disclosing this information.

Edward Snowden
* Former US CIA employee who leaked a huge amount of classified information pertaining to US surveillance programs.
* He is currently sought by US authorities, who have charged him with two charges of violating the Espionage Act and theft of government property, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
* He is currently living in temporary asylum in Russia.

I am not trying to compare these guys to Christian founders. But the similarities and struggles do look fairly similar.

And in all of this, we know that Christ is coming!


Some call our time the Pax Americana. The period of American peace. Of Western peace.

The New Testament contains two letters from Peter to Christians everywhere. They are addressed to a Christian audience that is scattered and being persecuted. Scholars suggest that these letters were written anywhere from 60 to 160 AD. So, this is anywhere from 30 to over 100 years after Jesus' crucifixion and the subsequent crackdown on his disciples and followers.

Peter's letters are meant to remind Christians to have faith and to hold onto the memory and the teaching of Jesus.

In 2 Peter, Peter tells us that Jesus will return. His timetable isn't clear, but we are reminded that time is different for God. A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day. The day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief.

And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.
And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved.

Peter tells us to make every effort to be found living peaceful lives.

At this very point in my preparation something happened - the timing couldn't have been better:
Yesterday, as I was finishing this sermon, I was sitting upstairs typing away, music playing on my ipod. Over the music, I could hear my kids fighting downstairs and Julie mediating in the dispute. It was funny, because this interruption occurred just as I was typing the words "peaceful lives".

And it is quite fitting: as I heard this struggle, I wished that my children could be peaceful towards each other. I wished that they would stop fighting. I wished that they would realize the gift that they had between them. The gift of siblings, family and love.

And my sermon came full circle.

My sister and I no longer talk. Because of a conflict that is bigger than either of us, but yet, it is a conflict that envelops all of us.


But Peter is right: while I am waiting for Christ to return, I need to make every effort to be found living a peaceful life that are pure and blameless in his sight.



Jesus has provided us with his instruction: Love God and love your neighbour. This is his instruction for us.

We are instructed to demonstrate love in all that we do, regardless of what is done to us. Jesus and his disciples demonstrated this in the face of persecution. Jesus forgave his executioners.

People were not expecting this announcement to come in combination with a call to repentance. They were waiting for a figure on a white horse, for companies of soldiers that would lead the people of Israel in the defeat of Rom. Instead, they are confronted by a man covered in camel's hair who invites people to identify with their ancestors' walk to freedom, to walk through the waters. This walk in the waters combines repentance with deliverance; it is a walk that is necessary for entering God's new kingdom. It leads not to an overthrow of the Roman oppressors but to a kingdom of peace, in a deeper sense of the word.

How many of you have conflict with someone around you? A family member, a spouse, an ex, a friend, a co-worker or anyone else that you interact with. It's hard, isn't it. You could both be right, you could both be wrong, but nobody wants to admit it. So you hold onto your anger, your frustration and your judgment.

And hate grows. And it is evil. It hurts you. It hurts the one you are in conflict with. It hurts those around you. It just hurts.

I am hurt. I am angry. I am self-righteous. I have hate. And I feel evil for it. And I hate the way that makes me feel.

But mostly, I have loss.
* lost family
* lost community
* lost holidays together

I don't know how this story will end. It is a sad story. It is a real story. And it is a story with plenty of hurt. At first glance, it is a story of a broken relationship between siblings. But when we look at it, it is much more. It is a haunting story of a lack of right relationship between family. It is a haunting story of a lack of right rleationship with ourselves. And it is also a haunting story of a lack of right relationship with God.


I have been searching for a solution. On matters of conscience, I sometimes look to Dietrich Bonhoeffer for guidance. Bonhoeffer died in contradiction to his beliefs. Bonhoeffer was a pacifist who held that the beatitudes were instructive tools for life. Ultimately, Bonhoeffer lost his life because of an action that ran counter to his beliefs: he was captured and executed as a conspirator in a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

Bonhoeffer said, "The right way to requite evil, according to Jesus, is not to resist it."
Further, "The only way to overcome evil is to let it run itself to a standstill because it does not find the resistance it is looking for."


I actively resist. But should I?

Reword / incorporate in my writing:
As Christmas Day approaches, many people find comfort and meaning in rituals they celebrate every year. But those rituals can lose their sparkle over time. Growth and newness can occur when familiar rituals are altered by actions that align with God's intentions, which lead to the peace of Christ ruling our hearts and lives. Adjust your Christmas rituals by inviting new people to celebrate Christmas with you, initiating a gathering in your neighbourhood, or by Christmas caroling for those who are in extended care. These changes may be unnerving, but they also hold the promise of renewal as we extend the peace of Christ to others.

Maybe we should use the holidays to:
* build new traditions
* to repair damaged relationships
* to remind us to be kind to our fellow people
* to reach out to others around us


For me, this year:
I look to the holidays and the potential to welcome Christ into the world.
I look to the holidays where we welcome Christ and his unconditional love.
I look to the holidays as a kindle to bridge conflict.
I look to the holidays and wish for the peace of Christ.
