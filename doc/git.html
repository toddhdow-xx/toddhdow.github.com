<pre>
We'll work with this repo: https://github.com/toddhdow/toddhdow.github.com.git

1. Pull down a repo: = clone:
In the terminal: git clone git@github.com:toddhdow/toddhdow.github.com.git

git remote -v = tells you the location of the repository;
git branch = which branch we're on;
git status = status;
git reflog = tells me the commit # that I am at;

git remote -v shows us the short names of where this code is related;
 - we can then use those short names (origin) instead of the longer location names (git@github.com/toddhdow/toddhdow.github.com.git);

EDITING YOUR CODE:
Edit readme.md - add your name to the content of the file;
Save.
In terminal: git status
it will show that changes have been made.
git add . - this will add the files to be committed (. = all files)

git commit -m "added Todd to readme.md"
git reflog - shows the revisions of the repo;

git push origin master = attempt to commit the code to the master;

Let's reset our code so that we don't mess with master.
git reset HEAD^1

we will now pull the original git repo and overwrite our changes:
git checkout -- README.md (case sensitive)
or, wildcard: git checkout -- *

Next, we'll create a branch:
git help branch = man page re all of the details

git branch -a = list all branches

git branch right = create new branch called right
git branch = all branches that we own
git branch -a = all branches

git checkout right = switch to branch
git push origin right = this will add the branch to the remote repo so that it is tracked.
git pull origin right
git pull origin left
git checkout left
(for some reason, the above lines weren't working - so - follow the below steps to access branch left)

### check in files = push:
git branch left
git checkout left
add a new file  - todd.txt using textedit
git add .
git commit -m 'added todd.txt file'
git reflog (to review)
git push origin left = Mark committed previously - so, this should fail;

pull versus rebase:
 - pull shows you the elapsed time form when you first pulled and the commit (shows the total duration);
 - rebase allows you to shorten the time that you have actually been working on a branch;

So now, we need to repull:
git status (to confirm we're on left branch)
if not on left branch: "git checkout left"
git pull origin master
git pull origin left
git push origin left

close out the topic branch:
master owner can then merge a branch into the master;
using github, you can merge the branches into master.


Forking code:
I'd like to work on a project, but I want my own separate set of code, and then I can submit back to the project if I want to at a later time.

cleanup:
This will remove from my local machine:
git branch -d right
git branch -d left

This will remove from my git repo:
git push origin --delete left = this will kill this branch;


Rebase:
git reflog
git reset HEAD^1
git rebase --onto --root


Help on versioning:
It's okay to delete branches.
Use tags to tag release #s.

To revert back:
git reset --hard f52273c (reset to an earlier reflag #)
git commit -m "reset back to the beginning" (commit w/ comment)
git push origin master --force (force an update to the master branch on the origin)
