Instructions for migrating my blog content from wordpress to jekyll:
Reference: http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
I used ec2 to do this, as my laptop is a bit old and didn't have the latest software installed (including XCode).
My exact steps were as follows - your steps may vary slightly depending on how "ready" your environment is:
1. Go to wordpress and obtain an extract of your blog in xml format (tools, export)
2. Copy your wordpress.xml file to ec2 - I use scp to get it there from my local machine:
- scp wordpress.xml -i locationofcertfile your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory
3. log in to ec2
4. sudo yum install -y install gcc mysql-devel ruby-devel rubygems
5. gem install mysql
6. sudo yum install libxml2-devel libxslt-devel
7. gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries=true --with-xml2-include=/usr/include/libxml2/
8. sudo yum install nodejs npm --enablerepo=epel
9. gem install hpricot
10. gem install jekyll-import
Done!
