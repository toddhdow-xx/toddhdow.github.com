<p>This site is written by me, Todd Dow. I'm a writer, geek (Senior Digital Specialist @ Postmedia) &amp; CF fundraiser. My wife, my kids, faith, baseball, infosec &amp; devops are a few of my favourite things.</p>
<p>On this blog, I write primarily about <a title="Technology" href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/technology/">technology</a>, <a title="Philosophy" href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/philosophy/">philosophy</a> and <a title="Cystic Fibrosis" href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/cystic-fibrosis/">cystic fibrosis</a> (my daughter has CF). You can review <a title="Archive" href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/archive/">an archive of my writing</a> or you can read through <a title="Posts" href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/posts/">all of my posts chronologically</a>.</p>
<p>You can find me online on <a href="http://www.github.com/toddhdow">github</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/toddhdow">twitter</a>, <a href="//plus.google.com/112156093119748555087?prsrc=3">Google+</a>, <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/toddhdow">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/toddhdow">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/toddhdow">Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>Professionally, I specialize in information security, risk management and IT operations. I have earned my Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) and Project Management Professional (PMP) designations. I participate in various local conferences and groups (<a title="Sector" href="http://sector.ca/">Sector</a>, <a title="SC Congress Toronto 2013" href="http://congress.scmagazine.com/page.cfm/link=10">SC Congress</a>, <a href="http://www.task.to/">TASK</a>) and I follow numerous infosec initiatives, including <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>, <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/">Backtrack</a>, <a href="http://www.kali.org/">Kali</a>, <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/">BlackHat</a> and <a href="http://computer-forensics.sans.org/">SANS Computer Forensics</a>. As a point of personal pride, I won a prize for being in the top 3 participants within the first hour of a three hour hack night at a <a title="Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge" href="http://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=cyber-readiness-challenge">Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge</a> in Toronto in 2012. Unfortunately, I did not place in the top 3 at the end of the night - I got tripped up by a stupid mistake early in the competition that slowed my progress.</p>
<p>In addition to my IT work, I also like to write. I have <a title="Books by Todd Dow" href="http://toddhdow.com/my-books/">published some books already</a>, and I have plenty of other books in various states of completion. The working titles for some of my upcoming projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="line-height:1.5em;" title="Cystic Diagnosis – Coming Soon!" href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/cystic-diagnosis-coming-soon/">Cystic Diagnosis</a></li>
<li><a style="line-height:1.5em;" title="Holy War – Coming Soon!" href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/holy-war-coming-soon/">Holy War</a></li>
<li>Additional <a title="Cryptogeddon Mission Packs" href="http://toddhdow.com/cryptogeddon/">Cryptogeddon Mission Packs</a></li>
<li>Cryptogeddon: The Novel</li>
</ul>
<p>I earned my Honours Computer Systems Technology Diploma from <a title="Mohawk College" href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/">Mohawk College</a> in 1997. As well, I earned my Specialist Honours Degree in Philosophy and Religious Studies from the <a title="University of Toronto" href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> in 2006. Additionally, I have completed some graduate work at <a title="McMaster Divinity College" href="http://www.mcmasterdivinity.ca/">McMaster Divinity College</a>. Previously, I earned my second degree black belt in the martial arts of karate, tae kwon do and jiu jitsu. This grounding in both eastern and western philosophical and religious traditions has provided a breadth and depth of experience that I bring to my writing and critical thinking.</p>
<p>One last thing… I work at Postmedia as a Senior Digital Specialist. This blog does not reflect the views of my employer. And, I want to confess a few things. Read <a title="Disclosure" href="http://toddhdow.com/disclosure/">my full disclosure</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the visit and stay in touch!</p>
