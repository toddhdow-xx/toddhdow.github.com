<h3>Definitions:</h3>
<p>With language, one of the biggest problems is using a common vocabulary. In my writing, I will try to keep consist with these definitions when using these terms. And, if a term isn't listed here that you feel is necessary to add, please do drop me a line or add a comment to this page.</p>
