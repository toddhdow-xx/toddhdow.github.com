Get wireless working:
Follow instructions on this page for GNOME:
https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse
(copied here for reference)

GNOME
Ensure your user account is a member of the netdev group.
Install the network-manager-gnome package:
$ su
# apt-get update
# apt-get install network-manager-gnome
Log out of GNOME, then log back in to your system.
A new applet (computer icon) will appear in the notification area / system tray. Left-click this icon to present the nm-applet pop-up menu.
Neighboring wireless networks with a broadcasted SSID should be listed:
Click on the desired network's name.
If the network uses WPA encryption with a password (aka passphrase/pre-shared key), you will be prompted to enter it. After providing, click the "Connect" button.
The wireless network connection will be activated.
If the desired network is not listed (e.g. SSID not broadcast/hidden):
Click "Connect to Other Wireless Network...".
Enter the network's SSID at "Network Name".
If encryption is used, select the method from the "Wireless Security" drop-down list (usually "WPA Personal" or "WPA2 Personal").
Enter the passphrase/pre-shared key at "Password".
Click the "Connect" button to activate the wireless network connection.

Voila! Wireless networking!
