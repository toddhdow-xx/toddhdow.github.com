To flash an image:

mount
sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1*
sudo dd if=kali-1.0.9-cubox-i.img of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=4096
(control+T to see progress of image creation)

Insert disk into cubox-i4pro, plug in peripherals and power it up. Voila!

INCREASE PARTITION SIZE
source: http://askubuntu.com/questions/116351/increase-partition-size-on-which-ubuntu-is-installed

I have 1 drive with two partitions:
/dev/mmcblk0p1
/dev/mmcblk0p2

Note, for the below steps: data is not written to the disk until you write the changes to the disk in the las step.

1. sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
 a) use p to list the partitions. Make note of the start cylinder of /dev/mmcblk0p2
 b) use d to delete first the second partition (2) and then the /dev/mmcblk0p2 partition.
 c) use n to create a new primary partition. Make sure its start cylinder is exactly the same as the old /dev/mmcblk0p2 used to have. For the end cylinder agree with the default choice, which is to make the partition to span the whole disk.
 d) review your changes, take a deep breath and use w to write the new partition table to disk. You'll get a message telling that the kernel couldn't re-read the partition table because the device is busy, but that's ok.

2. Reboot with sudo reboot. When the system boots, you'll have a smaller filesystem living inside a larger partition.

3. Finally, run resize2fs. Run sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2 - this form will default to making the filesystem to take all available space on the partition.

Voila! All done. Your sd card should now be fully utilized.

(optional) Get wireless working:
I think setting up wireless networking is making my system hang on reboot.
I'm not going to install wireless for the time being.

Follow instructions on this page for GNOME:
https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse
(copied here for reference)

GNOME
Ensure your user account is a member of the netdev group.
Install the network-manager-gnome package:
$ su
# apt-get update
# apt-get install network-manager-gnome
Log out of GNOME, then log back in to your system.
A new applet (computer icon) will appear in the notification area / system tray. Left-click this icon to present the nm-applet pop-up menu.
Neighboring wireless networks with a broadcasted SSID should be listed:
Click on the desired network's name.
If the network uses WPA encryption with a password (aka passphrase/pre-shared key), you will be prompted to enter it. After providing, click the "Connect" button.
The wireless network connection will be activated.
If the desired network is not listed (e.g. SSID not broadcast/hidden):
Click "Connect to Other Wireless Network...".
Enter the network's SSID at "Network Name".
If encryption is used, select the method from the "Wireless Security" drop-down list (usually "WPA Personal" or "WPA2 Personal").
Enter the passphrase/pre-shared key at "Password".
Click the "Connect" button to activate the wireless network connection.

Voila! Wireless networking!

Install nmap:
Follow install instructions on this page:

$ make install

8.
$ sudo checkinstall (I couldn't get this line to work)

9. Run nmap:
nmap -V

Voila!
