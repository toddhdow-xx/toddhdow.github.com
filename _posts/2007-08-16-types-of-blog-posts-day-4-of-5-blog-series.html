<p>In this 5 part series, we're examining <a href="http://wirepaper.com/2007/08/10/5-days-of-blog-posts/">5 Different Types of Blog Posts</a>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/red_4of5.png" alt="Post 4 of 5 (red)" align="left" />There are times when you have an ambitious message to get out to your audience. You want to cover a bunch of stuff and you're not sure how best to structure it. A good rule of thumb is to keep blog posts short and easy to read. So, that rules out generating complex posts. So, why not break up a complex post into multiple posts?</p>
<p>Blog series are just that - a series of blog posts that has a unifying theme. Take this current blog series as an example. I wanted to convey my tips pertaining to different types of blog posts. I didn't want to just provide a very basic list and leaving it at that. And I also didn't want to provide a HUGE blog post containing all of this info. So, I broke it up into sections.</p>
<p>Here are the steps that I took to build this series:</p>
<ol>
<li>I made a <strong>high-level list of items</strong> that I wanted to present. In this case, I was able to brainstorm 7 key types of blog posts.</li>
<li>I organized those items into a <strong>structured list</strong>. I managed to categorize the 7 items into a 5 item list.</li>
<li>I <strong>expanded upon each item</strong> in the structured list. This became the text of each blog entry.</li>
<li>I settled on a <strong>unifying theme</strong> to tie it all together. This was the "5 Days of Blog Posts" title that I gave to this series.</li>
<li>I generated a <strong>simple, eye-pleasing badge</strong> (the Day X of 5 badge) to dress up the posts a little and to provide a bit of a legend to the post in relation to the rest of the series.</li>
<li>I <strong>built the blog posts</strong> in Wordpress and <strong>scheduled them for publication in advance</strong>. I wrote these posts a week in advance. this allowed me to be a week ahead of my post schedule and it also alleviated the stress of needing to produce a blog post on short notice.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of my favourite things about blog series' is that they allow me to be more verbose. In each blog post, I do my best to be concise and to the point. The ability to elaborate on each point means that I explain things with more detail, which adds value for the reader.</p>
<p>And, a blog series gives the reader a reason to come back each day. As long as the content is strong, it should keep your readers coming back throughout the series to see what's going to happen next.</p>
<p>That's it for today. Until tomorrow, tag!</p>
