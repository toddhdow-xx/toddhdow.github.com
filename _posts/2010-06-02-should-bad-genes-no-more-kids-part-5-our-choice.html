<p>In our case, we have chosen to have another child. We have chosen to love this child. We have chosen to care for this child. And we have chosen to face whatever challenges come our way.</p>
<p>And, we will embrace technology to the extent that it can help. Medical research has gone a long way towards understanding cystic fibrosis. A cure remains elusive, but, I am optimistic that a cure will be found.</p>
<p>We look at Katie's smiling face every day and in spite of the challenges that CF presents, we celebrate her life daily. I couldn't imagine life without her. Similarly, a few weeks from now, I won't be able to imagine our family without the new life that we are about to be blessed with.</p>
<p>So I ask again, what would you do? (please do offer comments)</p>
<p>Todd</p>
