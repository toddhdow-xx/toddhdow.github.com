<p>Wow - thanks for your feedback! I got more responses than I expected. And, your responses were very helpful. Based on your feedback, here is the order in which I'll be completing my upcoming writing projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cystic Diagnosis</li>
<li>The God Solution</li>
<li>Holy War</li>
</ol>
<p>This order works for me and it helps clarify my priorities. Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>So stay tuned - I'll have some updates coming shortly pertaining to Cystic Diagnosis. You can expect some progress updates, free samples, a couple more surveys and perhaps a contest or two.</p>
<p>Talk soon!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
