<p>Folks,</p>
<p>Just wanted to send out a big thank you to everyone that made this year's Great Strides Cystic Fibrosis fundraiser a HUGE success. Julie and I continue to be overwhelmed by the tremendous outpouring of generosity and encouragement towards this cause. Your contributions, support, prayers and encouragement have been extremely uplifting to us.</p>
<p>The day was fantastic. The weather was perfect. The kids had a blast. And the event was a success.</p>
<p>Some numbers from today:<br />Total money raised for the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation = $1,743,943+<br />Total money raised for the Niagara-Hamilton Great Strides Walk = $82,359+<br />Total money raised for Team Katie = $13,293<br />Total sponsors for Team Katie = 210<br />Total Team Katie walkers yesterday = 53</p>
