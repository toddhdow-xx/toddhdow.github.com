<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-188" alt="Mission Cover - Mission Pack 4" src="assets/mission-cover-mission-pack-41.png?w=187" width="187" height="300" />Folks,</p>
<p>I must apologize for the long delay in launching Mission Pack 4. The last two months have been filled with various personal issues that have kept me from focusing on getting this Mission Pack out to you. And for that, I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>But rest easy. Cryptogeddon Mission Pack 4: Mobile Chop Shop is now available!</p>
<p>You can purchase your copy on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFY6PLM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HFY6PLM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wirepaper-20" target="a4">Amazon.com</a>. It'll be available on Kobo shortly.</p>
<p><b>Mission Pack 4 brings with it some interesting new challenges:</b></p>
<p><i>We have recovered an Android smartphone that belongs to an organized crime member who goes by the name Joe “The Fence” Arduino. Joe, and at least two other unknown individuals, were recently involved in the theft of a large volume of electronic equipment from a large electronics superstore.</i></p>
<p><i>Joe’s Android phone is the only evidence that we currently have.</i><br />
<i></i></p>
<p><i>Your assignment is to identify Joe’s accomplices and the inventory and distribution points for the stolen goods. We suspect that 3 local drop points exist in the Greater Toronto Area.</i><br />
<i></i></p>
<p>Mobile virtual devices, social media stalking, password hacking, website monitoring and more await!</p>
<p><b>And, in a new twist, Cryptogeddon is introducing the concept of “First Hackers”:</b></p>
<p>Starting with Mission Pack 4, Cryptogeddon is challenging participants to solve the mission pack without the solution. Participants have 1 week from the time this mission pack is released to complete the mission pack. After the first week, the complete Mission Pack, including the solution, will be published. The first 3 participants to complete the mission pack in the first week will be included in this First Hackers section when the updated mission pack is released. Depending on the number of responses that I receive in the first week, I may adjust the final number of First Hackers that are included in this section.</p>
<p>And don’t worry - anyone that purchases the mission pack in the first week will receive a copy of the updated mission pack when it is released at no additional charge.</p>
<p><b>Congratulations to the Mini Challenge Winners:</b></p>
<p>Big congratulations to the winners of the first Cryptogeddon Mini Challenge. Several people were successful in solving the first mini challenge. One person has won a free copy of Mission Pack 4. And, the rest of the winners received an email earlier today as a head start (and a 4 hour discount) for Mission Pack 4. People that successfully cracked the Mini Challenge were asked to send me their favourite hacking movie and/or quote of all time. Here are some of the responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wargames (Two people submitted this movie. The first person that submitted this one wins the free Mission Pack - check your email - it should be in your inbox!)</li>
<li>"There is no spoon." (from The Matrix)</li>
<li>"There's a war out there, old friend. A world war. And it's not about who's got the most bullets. It's about who controls the information. What we see and hear, how we work, what we think... it's all about the information!" --Cosmo, from Sneakers</li>
<li>Whistler: "That was very good, Bish. Remind me to make you an honorary blind person." (from Sneakers)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, one person asked me, "Do these get harder?" We'll have to see what i can do with future Mini Challenges.</p>
<p>So don’t delay. Pick up Cryptogeddon Mission Pack 4: Mobile Chop Shop today!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
