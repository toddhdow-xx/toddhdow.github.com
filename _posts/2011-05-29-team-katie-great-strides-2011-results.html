<p>To all Team Katie supporters,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your generous contributions to Team Katie in support of the 2011 Great Strides fundraiser. We continue to be overwhelmed by the tremendous outpouring of generosity and encouragement that we've received from you, our friends, as we do what we can to help find a cure for Cystic Fibrosis.</p>
<p>This annual fundraiser has been a huge motivator for us. In many ways, we feel powerless to help Katie. Our fundraising efforts have been one of the key ways that we've had to focus our energy in a positive way to help Katie live a long, healthy life. The funds that we raise are efficiently used to support CF patients and to help find a cure.</p>
<p>Some numbers from today:<br />
Total money raised for the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation = $1,961,608+<br />
Total money raised for the Niagara-Hamilton Great Strides Walk = $107,686<br />
Total money raised for Team Katie = $17,154<br />
Total sponsors for Team Katie = 243<br />
Total Team Katie walkers today = 80</p>

<p>Your monetary contributions have been a huge source of inspiration for us and we thank you for that. Not only are you helping fund the fight to beat CF, but each of you have also given our family a boost - we live with CF on a daily basis. We try not to get down, and most of the time, we're okay. But, sometimes it all catches up with us. The weight of a fatal disease in the family makes for some grim thoughts from time to time. But, we feel comfort knowing that we have so many friends that support us and rally behind us in this cause.</p>
<p>To everyone that has helped us this year, we thank you. Each of you, in contributing your time, money, thoughts and prayers are helping to save Katie's life. And for that, we are eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Much love,</p>
<p>Todd, Julie, Noah, Katie &amp; Riley</p>
