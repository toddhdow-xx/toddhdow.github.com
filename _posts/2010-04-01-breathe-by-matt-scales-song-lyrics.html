<p>Our Team Katie video for 2010 features the song Breathe, from <a href="http://www.cfvoice.com/info/breathe/index.jsp" target="new1">Matt Scales</a>, a CF patient who died from the disease in 2007 at 28 years of age.</p>
<p>Matt's personal struggle with CF made the song especially poignant, given his intimacy with the disease.</p>
<p>You can view more information about Matt and you can also download an mp3 copy of the song as well as an mp4 video of the song at this URL: <a href="http://www.cfvoice.com/info/breathe/index.jsp" target="new2">http://www.cfvoice.com/info/breathe/index.jsp</a></p>
<p>Here are the lyrics to the song, Breathe:</p>
<p>Breathe<br />By Matt Scales<br />Through my eyes<br />I see you<br />Staring at me<br />All the time.<br />So I wish<br />That it would leave<br />My body.<br />I wish I could breathe<br />Like you, oh, breathe<br />I know the answer’s out there.<br />So won’t you help me, please?<br />Chorus:<br />Then one day I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe, I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe like you.<br />Then one day I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe, I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe like you.<br />I see the future.<br />It seems so clear.<br />That one day I’ll breathe like you.<br />Then I think that<br />I’m all right<br />But it keeps changin’<br />Like the weather.<br />It’s not up to me<br />How I feel<br />How I feel<br />Inside.<br />I wish I could breathe<br />Like you, oh, breathe<br />I know the answer’s out there.<br />Won’t you help me, please?<br />Chorus:<br />Then one day I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe, I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe like you.<br />Then one day I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe, I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe like you.<br />I see the future.<br />It seems so clear.<br />That one day I’ll breathe like you.<br />I wish I could breathe<br />Like you, oh, breathe<br />I know the answer’s out there.<br />Won’t you help me...please?<br />Cause one day I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe, I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe like you.<br />Then one day I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe, I’ll breathe<br />I’ll breathe like you.<br />I see the future.<br />It seems so clear.<br />That one day I’ll breathe like you…like you.</p>
