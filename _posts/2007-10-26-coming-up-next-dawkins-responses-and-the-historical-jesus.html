<p>Folks, my apologies for being absent for the last few of weeks. I've got a bunch of excuses for my tardy responses to The God Delusion series, but I'll spare you the details.</p>
<p>The good news is that I have a bunch of new content for you. I haven't forgotten about the numerous comments that I received to my Dawkins series. I have been thinking these through and will be addressing some of the more prominent responses in the upcoming days.</p>
<p>And, related to that, I've been working hard on a paper for school that discusses the historical Jesus. The book, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0670067245?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=toddhdow-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0670067245" target="oc261"><em>In Defense Of Atheism by Michel Onfray</em></a><img src="assets/ir?t=toddhdow-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=0670067245" style="border:medium none!important;margin:0!important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, challenges the validity of the historical Jesus and my paper critiques Onfray's arguments. I'll be posting this paper as a multi-part series over the next week or so.</p>
<p>So stay tuned. There's plenty of exciting content to come. And again, my apologies for the gap in my posts...</p>
<p>Todd</p>
