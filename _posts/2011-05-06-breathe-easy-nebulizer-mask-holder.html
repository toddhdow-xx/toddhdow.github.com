<p>All CF parents out there, you must check out this product: <a title="Breathe Easy" href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/45103961/breathe-easy-nebulizer-mask-holder" target="_blank">The Breathe Easy Nebulizer Mask Holder</a></p>
<p>What a great device! Julie found this online and ordered one. Order total = $31.50 which includes shipping. The device even came with an extra "Bubbles the Fish Pediatric Aerosol Mask", which is a bonus so that we can rotate masks more often.</p>
<p>To use it, all you do is put the strap on your child's head, adjust the fish mask on the face and then attach the nebulizer to the front of the mask.Â Easy as 1 2 3.</p>
<p>The product creator, Melissa, was motivated to make this mask holder for a friend's child, who has CF. According to Melissa, "This mask holder was created for a friend of mine to help with her son's breathing treatments. Her little boy has Cystic Fibrosis and must have multiple breathing treatments every day. She struggled with getting the nebulizer mask, with its flimsy elastic strap, to stay on his head securely."</p>
<p>And, as an added bonus, Melissa will also donate a portion of any purchase referred by Breathing As A Family to Cystic Fibrosis Canada! Simply mention that you heard about this here (and mention Team Katie) during the checkout process (there is a spot for additional comments on Etsy when you place your order) and Melissa will do the rest.</p>
<p>Thanks to Melissa (<a title="mktdesigns" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/mktdesigns" target="_blank">mktdesigns on Etsy</a>) for providing such a great product.</p>
<p>Please pass this along to any other CF families that you know!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
