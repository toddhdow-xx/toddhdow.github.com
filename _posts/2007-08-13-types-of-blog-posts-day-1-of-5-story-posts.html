Story posts are meant to convey some sort of message. These posts can be long or short, depending on how much or how little you want to invest in the story at hand. The important thing with stories is to connect with your reader. With stories, you, as the writer, are trying to build a personal connection with your reader. Stories allow you to put the reader right in the middle of the action. Good storytellers will immerse the reader so completely that they feel that they are experiencing the story firsthand.</p>
<p>Thinking back on my undergrad years as a philosophy major at the University of Toronto, I recall a writing assignment I was given in a course called "Modern Atheism". The assignment was to write a dialogue between a Christian and an Atheist about the existence of God. This assignment took me completely by surprise. I was so used to writing argumentative essays that contained an opening argument, supporting points and a strong conclusion. How was I supposed to switch gears and write a work of fiction, albeit a fiction that contained relevant coursework that we had been discussing for most of the semester?</p>
<p>Creative writing has never been my strong suit. Needless to say, I was glad when the assignment was over. Surprisingly, I did well on the assignment. More importantly though, being forced to write in a way that was so uncomfortable to me challenged me to grow and to expand my writing skillset.</p>
<p>I learned a few things from my atheistic creative writing exercise. Here are some of the important points that I gained from this exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage the reader</li>
<li>Develop more than just the facts and figures of your arguments. In fact, surround those facts with a personal story that engages the reader.</li>
<li>Expose yourself in your post. Share some personal information with the reader. This makes them more likely to connect with you and remember you.</li>
<li>Provide examples that readers can relate to. Stories allow for the sharing of like experiences. This builds relationships and strengthens bonds between people.</li>
<li>Feed the reader's senses and emotions.</li>
<li>Engage the reader. Wait, did I say that already?</li>
</ul>
<p>Be creative. Wrap your message up in a meaningful story and watch how much more memorable that post will be. Personalizing your facts and figures is a great way to connect with your readers and to have them remember you.</p>
<p>Talk soon!</p>
