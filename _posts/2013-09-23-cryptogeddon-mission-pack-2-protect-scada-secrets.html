<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-195" alt="Mission Cover - Mission Pack 2" src="assets/mission-cover-mission-pack-21.png?w=187" width="187" height="300" />Authorities recently discovered that foreign militants are in possession of North American public infrastructure plans, focusing primarily on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The documentation includes architectural and system drawings, security assessments and vulnerability reports. Intelligence indicates that bloggers are prepping the public release of this information and that they will be encouraging sleeper cells in various North American cities to carry out attacks on public infrastructure vulnerabilities that are outlined in the documents.</p>
<p>Intelligence indicates that the militants are working with the blog scadaplans.cryptogeddon.com.</p>
<p>Your assignment is to find the documents, extract them from the bloggers’ CMS before they are able to publish the documents online and identify the target infrastructure and their vulnerabilities so that they can be hardened against attack.</p>
<p>NOTE: This mission requires the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 and this mission is compatible with <a title="Amazon Web Services Free Tier" href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services' Free Tier</a>.</p>
