<p><strong>Day 1 - Tues June 11 2013:</strong><br />
<em>11:45am - “Big Data”</em></p>
<p>This presentation was a panel discussion discussing big data</p>
<p>I didn’t take many notes at this session. There was plenty of good discussion, but nothing noteworthy.</p>
<p>One funny quote from the session: “NSA’s Prism = the best data backup program ever.”</p>
