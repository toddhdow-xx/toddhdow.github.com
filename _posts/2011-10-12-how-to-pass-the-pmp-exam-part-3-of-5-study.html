<p>You must complete 35 contact hours (formal PM training by a certified PMI training provider) in order to quality for the PMP exam. This is normally the most expensive part of the exam process. In class courses cost anywhere from $2000 to $4000 dollars for the 5 day course. This is a lot of money!</p>
<p>I wasn't interested in paying that kind of money especially when I have a lot of PM experience already. And, I retain info better when I self study. So, I started asking around to see what lower-cost options were available. And I found exactly what I was looking for:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.project-management-prepcast.com/" target="_blank">PM Prepcast</a></p>
<p>Advertised as, "Pass the PMP Exam the Easy Way", this exam study package provides podcasts (video and audio content), along with sample questions and additional study aids. And, it even includes a 35 contact hours certificate.</p>
<p>And the best part is the price: $99.</p>
<p>Yep - $99!</p>
<p>Needless to say, I was sold.</p>
<p>I bought the course. I received email links to my personal podcast course download. I downloaded the video and audio content to my computer and then used iTunes to sync it with my ipod. (You can also listen to and watch the content on your computer.)</p>
<p>Two weeks after I purchased the course, I was able to complete an online exam. Passing the exam presented me with my 35 contact hour certificate that I was able to download and print out to submit to PMI. The PM Prepcast product even gave me the exact details I needed to provide to PMI to accept this course for the 35 contact hours requirement.</p>
<p>If you study well on your own, this is a great deal!</p>
