<p>Folks,</p>
<p>Great news - the latest addition to the Dow family has finally arrived. Please welcome Riley John Dow. Riley was born at home on Tuesday June 1 at 9:50am. He weighed in at 9 lbs even. Julie and Riley are both doing fantastic.</p>
<p>Big thanks to the midwife team: Rachel, Colleen and Pilar. They were fantastic. They made the birth such a fantastic, relaxing and enjoyable experience. Well... as relaxing as it can be to be giving birth - keep in mind this being written by Todd, who does not have experience giving birth. :-)</p>
