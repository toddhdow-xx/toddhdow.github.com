<h3>Part four in my four part series entitled "What Are We Fighting For?"</h3>
<p>The question then becomes: what are we supposed to do? Do we just continue to turn the other cheek? Definitely. Lead by example. If you claim that you are a disciple of Jesus, then you have to live the part. That means standing up for the principles of Christian living, as they are provided to us in the Bible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I think we have to go further though. Others are speaking on our behalf in the public square. Christians are speaking up and saying that war is okay. Christians are speaking up and saying that violence is allowed if it’s in OUR best interests. It is our responsibility to speak up and correct these false assertions about Christianity. Ours is a religion of love and peace, not of war and domination.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have so much potential. We live in a land of free speech. We have access to the internet. Blogging is so simple. Writing and publishing books has become a breeze. Organizations like MCC are just waiting to help us channel our energies into positive changes across the world, represented by the healing and loving hand of Jesus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We need to embrace our gifts and take advantage of the opportunities available to us to make a difference, to represent our faith in a positive manner and to build a relationship of love and peace throughout the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let me leave you with this thought as I wrap up:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Current U.S. expenditures in Iraq (according to Harper’s, Oct 2006):</p>
<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal">$246      million each day, or more than $10 million an hour</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">direct      costs. And those costs continue to grow:
<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal">$77.3       billion in 2004</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">$87.3       billion in 2005</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">$100.4       billion in fiscal year 2006</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Estimated      that staying in Iraq      another four years will cost at least $1 trillion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">By comparison, Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2007 provided the following numbers required in Afghanistan:</p>
<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal">Amount      raised during a 2006 summit attended by approximately 60 countries with      the stated goal of providing economic and military aid to reconstruction      efforts: $11 Billion USD</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Amount      required, as per estimated provided by the World Bank and the Afghan      government: $28 Billion USD.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">Something is askew when priorities are that far out of whack. Imagine investing those war dollars into the local economies to make them self sufficient? I don’t know about you, but it sure seems like a better use of money than building bombs and bullets that will only further divide all of us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, it’s important that you don’t just take my word for it. Research the things that we’ve talked about today. Make up your own mind. And if you disagree, I’d love to talk further with you. I have yet to be convinced that the peace position is wrong.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My hope is that we will be able to work together to raise awareness of the radical reformation that the global Christian church requires sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you and God bless each and every one of you.</p>
