<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6690798">The Passage</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45315">Justin Cronin</a></p>
<p>My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/203233886">5 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>Incredible read! Cronin captures your attention on page 1 and doesn't let go until the last word on the last page.</p>
<p>This book took me three tries to finally get through it. It's a long book and I have a short attention span. (my fault, not a fault of the book) Thus, I kept getting distracted by other things while trying to get through the first 1/3 of the book. But, I kept coming back to it.</p>
<p>The book really caught my attention at around the half way mark, securing my attention for the roller coast ride that continued until the last page. As the book neared its climax, I was hooked and I couldn't put the book down even if I'd wanted to. Few books hold my attention like this book did.</p>
<p>Finishing the book is like turning a street corner and slipping off the end of the sidewalk into a blank nothingness - a lot is left unwritten, leaving the reader wanting, no needing, more.</p>
<p>Word is that Cronin is working on two additional books in this series. I'll definitely be reading them!</p>
