<p>I'm working on another series and hope to have it ready to go for next week. In the meantime, I'm going to post some links to some other sites that have recently provided some content similar to my last series. At the very least, this should provide some additional reading material pertaining to good blog posts. And, I've also included one or two fun sites from people I've met recently. Plenty of good stuff to read here.</p>
<p>Here goes:<br />
