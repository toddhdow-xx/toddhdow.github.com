<p><strong>Day 2 - Wed June 12 2013:</strong><br />
<em>9:50am - “Keynote: Supply Chain + cyber intelligence + (insert bad country) = Risk”, hosted by <a href="http://congress.scmagazine.com/page.cfm/Action=Visitor/VisitorID=64">Curtis Levinson</a>, U.S. cyber defense advisor to NATO</em></p>
<p>Curtis was a great storyteller. He shared plenty of stories pertaining to the origins and history of Stuxnet and a Maryland Sorority girl who found herself ostracized after posting offensive material on Facebook.</p>
<p>Curtis summarized his presentation by warning us to be careful where we get our computer equipment from. Beware of the potential for manufacturers (whether foreign or domestic) to insert malware and other spying mechanisms into the supply chain, and ultimately, into your environment.</p>
