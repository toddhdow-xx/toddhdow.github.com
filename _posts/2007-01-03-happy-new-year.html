<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Sorry for my lack of posts over the holidays. I indulged in friends and family to the max this holiday season, which was nice for a change. Previous Christmas breaks have been spent working, but I was fortunate enough to get the whole week off this year between Christmas and New Years. It was great!</p>
<p>In any event, I trust that you had a safe, happy and restful holiday season and I wish you all the best for 2007.</p>
<p>And, on a related note, I gave my second public sermon over the holidays. Sunday December 31st marked my second official pulpit appearance. I wasn't nervous this time (unlike last time), the feedback was good and I felt quite comfortable delivering my message entitled "Lent Time". I'll post the sermon in pieces over the next few days. Watch for it!</p>
<p>May God bless you and comfort you in your walk with him in 2007.</p>
