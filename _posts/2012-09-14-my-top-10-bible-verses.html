<dt>Hebrews 11:1</dt>
<dd>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</dd>
<dt>Hebrews 12:1-2</dt>
<dd>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</dd>
<dt>James 1:12</dt>
<dd>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</dd>
