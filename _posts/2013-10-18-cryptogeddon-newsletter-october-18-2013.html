<h3>Mission Pack 3 Launch Challenge:</h3>
<p>Mission Pack 3 is coming very soon and I’m turning the release into a hacking challenge. On launch, I’m going to release the Mission Pack WITHOUT the solution. The challenge is to be among the first to solve the Mission Pack without a solution. The first 3 people to solve the Mission Pack and email me the final “flag” (you’ll know it when you see it) will be added to a special “First Hackers” section within the final Mission Pack that includes the full solution. You’ll have one week to solve the Mission Pack without the solution, after which I will post the full Mission Pack including the solution and the “First Hackers” section (including up to the first 3 people to solve the Mission Pack by the end of the hacking challenge period).</p>
<h3>Mini Challenge:</h3>
<p>Want to win a free copy of Mission Pack 3? Want to get an email alert as soon as Mission Pack 3 is released (aka a head start)? I’m launching Cryptogeddon’s first Mini Challenge. Here are the rules and the prizes:</p>
<div><strong>Win a free copy of Mission Pack 3 − 1 winner - </strong>Be the first person to tweet “I just solved the first @cryptogeddon Mini Challenge. There are no secrets! #Infosec #ctf” AND send an email to me at toddhdow@gmail.com with a copy of the final solution (you’ll know what to send me when you see it).<strong>Get an email alert as soon as Mission Pack 3 is released - unlimited winners -</strong>tweet “I just solved the first @cryptogeddon Mini Challenge. There are no secrets! #Infosec #ctf” AND send an email to me at toddhdow@gmail.com with a copy of the final solution (you’ll know it when you see it).</p>
<p>The free copy and the email alerts will go out as soon as Mission Pack 3 is available for sale in the Cryptogeddon.com store. I’ll be sending a “Mission Pack 3 is now available” email to my entire distribution list 4 hours after it is available in the sore. That’ll give any early birds a 4 hour head start.</p>
<h3>Official Launch at Sector 2013</h3>
<p>Sector (Canada’s Premier IT Security Conference) was the initial catalyst behind the creation of Cryptogeddon. Therefore, it was fitting that I used Sector as the official launch trigger for Cryptogeddon. You can read the <a href="http://cryptogeddon.com/blogs/news/9497273-cryptogeddon-officially-launches-at-sector-2013" target="_self">official press release here</a>.</p>
<h3>Kickstarter Project?</h3>
<p>I’m debating on running a Cryptogeddon Kickstarter Project. My working title for the project is “The Ultimate Hacker’s Package” and it’ll include a custom Moleskine notebook with the Cryptogeddon logo embossed on the cover and a hacker cheat sheet on the inside cover, a custom USB drive, a t-shirt, printed copies of Mission Packs and more. Anyone interested? Any other suggestions to include in this “Ultimate Hacker’s Package”? Email me or tweet @cryptogeddon with your thoughts.</p>
<h3>In the News:</h3>
<p>Nat Torkington from O’Reilly Radar listed Cryptogeddon is his <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/10/four-short-links-17-october-2013.html" target="_self">Four short links for 17 October 2013</a>. This resulted in the largest one day traffic spike in Cryptogeddon history. Thanks Nat and the O’Reilly team for the shout out!</p>
<p>Slovakian website linuxos.sk mentioned Cryptogeddon in a <a href="http://linuxos.sk/spravy/detail/online-hra-cryptogeddon-orginalna-informacno-/" target="_self">News article on October 17</a>. (Gotta love Google Translate for helping me understand what the post said!)</p>
<h3>Upcoming Appearances:</h3>
<p><a href="http://task.to/" target="_self">TASK.TO</a>: I’ll be speaking at TASK.TO (Toronto Area Security Klatch) on the evening of <a href="http://task.to/calendar/vw/5/itemid/100/sm/1483/default.aspx" target="_self">Wednesday October 30</a>. I’ll be offering a repeat performance of my Sector 2013 session entitled, “CRYPTOGEDDON - Sector 2013 Edition: Online Cyber Security War Game”. In this session, I’ll walk the audience through a made-for-Sector-2013 mission pack. Admission and membership for TASK.TO are free. I encourage you to attend and to say hi if you meet me at this event.</p>
