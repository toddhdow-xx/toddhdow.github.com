<p>Welcome to my blog.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I am aware of the time that God has given me to do his bidding. I can spend that time doing many different things. I'd like to say that I'm perfect and that I live my life according to what God expects of me, but I'd be lying if I said that. But, I do try to think fairly often about what God expects of me and I try to apply those thoughts to my everyday life. While I'm far from perfect, I do try to get better each day, living life the way that God would want it.</p>
<p>This blog will attempt to summarize how one should attempt to use that "Lent Time". While I'm not the most authoritative source, I do try to base my writings on a protestant Christian worldview. As a Mennonite, I am very supportive of several key virtues including humility, peace, forgiveness, faith and love. These virtues, and many others, will be evident in my postings to come.</p>
<p>I hope you will join me in my journey of faith. For me, this is an exercise in organization. I hope to solidify my ministry using this blog. If all goes well, I hope to use this as a springboard to further spread the good news of the Christian faith. All in good time...</p>
<p>Matthew 24:36-46:<br />
<em>"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone... Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming. Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes."</em></p>
<p>May God bless you and keep you safe,</p>
<p>Todd Dow</p>
