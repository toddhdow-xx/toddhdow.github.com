<p>I'm a big fan of this post by carsonified: <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/17-awesome-web-developer-cheat-sheets/" target="_blank">17 Awesome Web Developer Cheat Sheets</a></p>
<p>There's nothing like a simple, one page cheat sheet referenceÂ for the stuff that you work with the most. All of the necessary functions at a glance. What more could you need?</p>
<p>In fact, this post by carsonified has motivated me so much, that I'm adopting this strategy at my day job. I manage an operations team and over the years, I've compiled a fairly robust set of documents that explains our processes. I'm in the middle of updating them. But, instead of editing/updating the docs as they currently exist, I'm scrapping the whole thing and replacing them with a small collection of one (or two, at most) page cheat sheets. If I can't fit all of the important stuff on a double sided sheet of paper, then there's too much to know, and the items on the cheat sheets will never be handled properly anyways.</p>
<p>We'll see how it works out. I suspect it'll lead to better understanding and use of established processes and tools.</p>
<p>Your turn to share: What topics/tasks would you like to see on a cheat sheet?</p>
