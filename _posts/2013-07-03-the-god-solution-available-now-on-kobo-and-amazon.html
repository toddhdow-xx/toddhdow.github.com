This means that you can read it on pretty much any device out there (ipod, iphone, android, etc.)</p>
<p>Here's a synopsis of the book:</p>
<p>In 2008, Richard Dawkins wrote a book called “The God Delusion”. The book offered a controversial critique of belief in God. I felt that his critique was flawed on numerous fronts. This book is a summary of my thoughts and a defence of my faith.</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins’ book, The God Delusion, has become a go to source for Atheists when they attempt to dispel the validity of religion. Unfortunately, Dawkins’ arguments are flawed. In this thought provoking book, Todd Dow refutes The God Delusion through a thorough analysis of Dawkins’ arguments. Chapter by chapter, I pinpoint the issues with Dawkins’ arguments, outlining the flaws in Dawkins’ logic and offering valid and sound responses to each of the issues that Dawkins addresses.</p>
<p>The following topics are addressed:<br />
Straw Men – Dawkins’ weak proofs of God<br />
The Ultimate 747 – Is that the best he’s got?<br />
Problems with Organized Religion<br />
The objective roots of morality<br />
The Historical Jesus<br />
The problem with fundamentalism<br />
The slippery slope of abortion<br />
Why not rid ourselves of religion, politics and economics?<br />
Childhood abuse and brainwashing<br />
On evolution and concluding thoughts</p>
<p>And, as an added bonus, I have included an appendix that contains a thought experiment entitled, “Should Atheists Have Children?”</p>
<p>Please do go pick up a copy of my book and let me know what you think - feel free to offer your feedback in the comments below and (more importantly) provide your feedback on my book page on Amazon.com or Kobobooks.com.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
