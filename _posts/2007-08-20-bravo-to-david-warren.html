<p>I don't easily agree with David Warren's writing, but he's on a rant against atheism right now, and I couldn't agree more with his current series of messages. Instead of stealing his thunder, I'll direct you right to his stuff:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?id=769" target="warren1">Unmoved mover</a><br />
<a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?id=772" target="warren2">More heresy</a><br />
That's it for now... just wanted to share those links.  Talk soon!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
