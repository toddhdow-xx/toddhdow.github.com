<p>Yes, I know it's already January 13th. I'm a bit late on my first post of the new year. :-)</p>
<p>The last few months have been rather hectic. Plenty going on. And yes, I have neglected our blog for far too long. For that, I apologize.</p>
<p>So, to get everyone up to speed, here's what we've been up to.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignright" width="230" caption="Dow Family 2010"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/sets/72157625816430500/"><img class="  " title="Dow Family 2010" src="assets/5091540067_8eb64bae60_z.jpg" alt="Dow Family 2010" width="230" height="173" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>October</strong>: Plenty of good times. We checked out <a href="http://www.niagaraadvance.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2780704">"Touch a Truck"</a> in Niagara. We celebrated Noah's 5th birthday. We visited <a href="http://bry-anne.farmvisit.com/">Bry-Anne Farms</a> in Fenwick, Ontario. The kids had a blast! And of course <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/sets/72157625158716725/">Halloween</a> was fun.</p>

<p><strong>November</strong>: Not much to report... Got ready for Christmas. Kept busy with work and play.</p>
<p><strong>December</strong>: Busy month. We started the month with a sick household. We think that the cold/flu/whatever it was hit us early this year, affecting all of us at one time or another. Katie seemed to keep healthiest - I suspect that her daily CF treatments helped keep her lungs clear, and thus, helped to keep her healthy as well.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Feeding the sheep"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/sets/72157625750581916/"><img class=" " title="Feeding the sheep" src="assets/5325957332_2073260b96.jpg" alt="Feeding the sheep" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>We had a special Christmas this year as well. We went to Ottawa to visit with my sister Stacey's family: Stacey, Paul, Ben &amp; Max. They have a bit of a hobby farm at their place. Needless to say the kids loved it. They even got to feed some sheep!</p>
<p>From there, we went to Julie's extended family Christmas, which was hosted by Julie's Uncle Steve and Aunt Ingrid in Ottawa this year. We had a great time there as well. Plenty of family time and we got out to see the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/sets/72157625750581916/">Museum of Civilization</a> in Hull, Quebec as well.</p>
<p>Which brings us to January. Plenty going on now as well. I'll update more on that in my next post. Watch for that post within the next couple of days.</p>
<p>And yes, that book is still on my list. I'm working on it.</p>
<p>Talk soon!</p>
<p>Todd, Julie, Noah, Katie &amp; Riley</p>
