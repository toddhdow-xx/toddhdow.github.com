<p><strong>On walk day, make sure you bring:</strong><br />
* your "manage online donations" and "manage cash and cheque donations" printouts;<br />
* your Great Strides t-shirt (if you have one from previous years);<br />
* dress for the weather - the walk will proceed rain or shine;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: we were asked for our t-shirt sizes late this year. We don't know if we'l be getting t-shirts this year. We'll find out on Sunday morning if we have new t-shirts for this year. If you have a t-shirt from last year, please wear it.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the ballpark agenda for the day:</strong><br />
9am: Assemble as a team;<br />
- get a team picture - here's <a title="Team Katie 2011" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/5774133232/in/set-72157626383527816/" target="_blank">last year's picture</a>;<br />
- submit your paperwork at the registration desk (each walker/family needs to register at the registration desk);<br />
9:30am: Go our separate ways and enjoy the walk through the park;<br />
11:30am: Meet as a team in the bandshell area (it'll be marked) to eat lunch<br />
- Last year, complimentary hot dogs &amp; pop were provided;<br />
- Bring your own drinks &amp; snacks;<br />
- For the kids: enjoy the bouncy castles, clown, balloon animals and face painting;<br />
1pm: Awards ceremony - top fundraisers get prizes!<br />
- stick around for this - in previous years, many Team Katie fundraisers received really nice prizes;</p>
