<p>In 2008, Richard Dawkins wrote a book called "The God Delusion". The book offered a controversial critique of belief in God. I felt that his critique was flawed on numerous fronts. This book is a summary of my thoughts and a defence of my faith.</p>
<p>The main outline of the book is as follows:<br />
1. Straw Men – Dawkins weak proofs of God<br />
2. The Ultimate 747 – Is that the best he’s got?<br />
3. Problems with Organized Religion and Sociological Explanations for Religion<br />
4. The objective roots of morality<br />
5. The Historical Jesus<br />
6. The problem with fundamentalism<br />
7. The slippery slope of abortion<br />
8. Why not rid ourselves of religion, politics and economics all at the same time?<br />
9. Childhood abuse and brainwashing<br />
10. On Evolution and concluding thoughts</p>
<p>This book is currently in development. Check back regularly for updates, sneak peaks and announcements pertaining to this book's publication timelines.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
