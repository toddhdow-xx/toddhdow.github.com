<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/sets/72157623622801160/show/" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><img border="0" height="240" src="assets/4584674375_6e8f6f3aaf.jpg" width="320" /></span></a></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">My daughter Katie was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis on Tuesday September 30 2008. Life changed for our family that day.</span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">This post series is a documentary of our family’s experiences in the time leading up to that diagnosis. Writing these posts have been a cleansing experience for me. Putting my thoughts into words is helping me to process our predicament. And it is also helping me to focus on next steps.</span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">My goals for writing these posts are two-fold:</span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"></div>
<ul>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">First, I hope to offer encouragement to other families that are faced with difficult health issues. Whether the struggles are Cystic Fibrosis or something else, there is a common understanding when we face our mortality and that of our loved ones. We share the same hopes, fears, dreams and disappointments.</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">Second, I hope to raise awareness for Cystic Fibrosis. Much has been accomplished, but there is still much to be achieved. I feel that we’ve measured how deep and wide the Grand Canyon is, and now in order to reach the other side we need to either build a bridge or fill it in. Uncovering the genetic source of the disease and enhanced treatment options to slow the progress of the disease have significantly improved the lives of CF patients. But the end goal remains elusive.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">I’ve been told that we’re fortunate. “At least she’s doing okay.” “It could be worse.” And my personal favourite, “She doesn’t look sick. Maybe she’s got a less severe kind of CF”. Most days, I tend to agree. Katie is doing well. She’s a little spitfire. She’s stubborn, tenacious and above all, she’s healthy. For now. But the truth is, she is sick. She needs her daily treatments. Without them, her health will degrade in a hurry. And, unless a cure is found, she will likely die from this disease at a younger age than any of us would like. And for the record, no, there is no "less severe kind of CF".</span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">But… for now, it’s not as dire as it sounds. Things COULD be worse. And she IS doing okay. But the question remains: for how long? We live every day in denial. Maybe CF won’t catch up with Katie. Maybe she will be one of the lucky ones that lives a full life, growing into adulthood, getting married, having kids, having grandchildren. Hopefully.</span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">In the meantime, we live each day to the fullest. We enjoy our time together as a family. We learn as much as we can about CF. We pray for a cure sooner rather than later. We fundraise and raise awareness in the hopes that it will make a difference. We do her treatments religiously. And we thank God for the time that we can spend together as a family.</span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div class="Body" style="margin:0;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:inherit;">Follow us for the next few days as we share our personal story of learning and accepting Katie's CF diagnosis.</span></div>
