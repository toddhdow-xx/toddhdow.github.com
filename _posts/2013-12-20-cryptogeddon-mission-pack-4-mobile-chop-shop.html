<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-201" alt="Mission Cover - Mission Pack 4" src="assets/mission-cover-mission-pack-41.png?w=187" width="187" height="300" />We have recovered an Android smartphone that belongs to an organized crime member who goes by the name Joe “The Fence” Arduino. Joe, and at least two other unknown individuals, were recently involved in the theft of a large volume of electronic equipment from a large electronics superstore.</p>
<p>Joe’s Android phone is the only evidence that we currently have.</p>
<p>Your assignment is to identify Joe’s accomplices and the inventory and distribution points for the stolen goods. We suspect that 3 local drop points exist in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST HACKERS CHALLENGE IS IN EFFECT:</strong><br />
Starting with Mission Pack 4, Cryptogeddon is challenging participants to solve the mission pack without the solution. Participants have 1 week from the time this mission pack is released to complete the mission pack. After the first week, the complete Mission Pack, including the solution, will be published. The first 3 participants to complete the mission pack in the first week will be included in this First Hackers section when the updated mission pack is released. Depending on the number of responses that I receive in the first week, I may adjust the final number of First Hackers that are included in this section.</p>
<p>And don’t worry - anyone that purchases the mission pack in the first week will receive a copy of the updated mission pack when it is released at no additional charge.</p>
