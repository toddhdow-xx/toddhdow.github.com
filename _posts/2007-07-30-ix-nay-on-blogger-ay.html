<p><a href="http://tisb.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/wordpresslogo1.jpg" title="wordpress logo"><img src="assets/wordpresslogo1.jpg" alt="wordpress logo" align="right" border="3" /></a>So... After just re-inventing Wirepaper on Blogger, I have decided to abandon it on Blogger and switch to Wordpress for it as well.</p>
<p>Why would I do this, you ask? Well... here's my reasoning:</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Blogger / Anti-Wordpress:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible layout/design: Blogger has a very flexible layout that can easily be tweaked.</li>
<li>Scripting: Blogger allows for javascript!</li>
<li>Monetization: Blogger allows for adsense (and many other ad networks via javascript)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro-Wordpress / Anti-Blogger:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Site layout/design: The template system resets if you change the default template. A lot of hard work goes down the drain in a hurry.</li>
<li>The default Blogger templates are rough around the edges. It takes a lot of work to make a blog look good.</li>
<li>Wordpress offers professional looking templates out of the box.</li>
<li>Where are the pages? In Blogger, to make various "pages" for your site, you create a blog posting and then use that new post as a new page. It works, but it's kludgey. In Wordpress, pages are quite intuitive and easy to use.</li>
<li>Wordpress allows for ALL of my blogs to be managed with one interface (including stats reporting).</li>
</ul>
<p>So... instead of struggle with the multiple platform approach, I thought I'd consolidate my blogs under one umbrella.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean I'm going to be anti-blogger from now on. In fact, Blogger has some great features that I'd love to continue to take advantage of. But like I said in my last post, I'm not a designer, and Wordpress takes the worry out of me doing the design work myself. I will miss the javascript functionality of blogger though. But who knows... If I build a big enough blog, I'll spin it off from the wordpress.com hosting and host it myself, at which time I'll be able to use javascript again (no javascript is a limitation of the free, hosted version of wordpress, but the self-host option enables you to use javascript as much as you want).</p>
<p>And really... for all the bells and whistles I can add to my blog, at the end of the day, my blog is about content. I will be able to take advantage of plenty of web2.0 functionality even if I am limited in what I can put into my blog directly. In fact, this'll just make it more fun trying to include stuff in my blog in a creative way that doesn't conflict with wordpress.com's limitations.</p>
<p>Talk soon!</p>
