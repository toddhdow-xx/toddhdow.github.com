<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-133" title="garagesale" src="assets/7090882999_a0a3457d43_n.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As part of our fundraising for Great Strides, we'll be running a garage sale on Saturday May 19 2012 from 8am until 2pm. We asked some of our neighbours to participate. Ideally, we'll be able to make it a street wide garage sale, with some of our neighbours participating.</p>
<p>Last year's event raised over $1,300. We are hoping to surpass that goal this year, and thanks to the generosity of friends and family, we have a lot more to sell this year than last. So, hopefully we'll be able to surpass last year's total.</p>
<p>Location:<br />
<strong>4418 Dennis Avenue in Beamsville</strong><br />

<p>Some things that you can do to help:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stop by</strong> on Saturday May 19 and find a treasure to take home</li>
<li><strong>Spread the word</strong> - let others know about this event and get them to stop by on May 19 as well</li>
<li><strong>Hope for sun on Sat May 19!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>And, here's the story behind the garage sale:</p>
<p><em>We are the Dow family and we live at 4418 Dennis Ave. Our daughter Katie has Cystic Fibrosis.</em></p>
<p><em>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, fatal genetic disease affecting Canadian children and young adults. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis. CF is a multi-organ disease, primarily affecting the lungs and digestive system. A build-up of thick mucus in the lungs causes severe breathing problems. It may be difficult to clear bacteria from the lungs, leading to cycles of infection and inflammation, which damage the delicate lung tissues.</em></p>
<p><em>Thick mucus also blocks the ducts of the pancreas, preventing enzymes from reaching the intestines to digest food. People with CF must consume a large amount of artificial enzymes (average 20 pills a day) with every meal and snack, to help digest and absorb adequate nutrition from food.</em></p>
<p><em>Katie has to endure 2 to 4 hours of treatment a day to try and loosen the mucous in her lungs as well as take enzymes just to be able to digest her food. The median survival age for someone with CF is 47.7. This just isn’t enough for us and Katie needs a cure.</em></p>
<p><em>On Saturday May 19th we are having a garage sale to raise funds for Cystic Fibrosis. We will be donating our proceeds to charity. In making this a street wide sale, we can advertise it that way and hopefully there will be a lot more traffic coming through the area. And, we are advertising in the local paper to help promote the event.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you so much!</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em>Todd, Julie, Noah, Katie and Riley Dow</em></p>
<p><em>p.s. If the weather is poor on Sat May 19, we will reserve Sunday May 20 as the rain date for this event.</em></p>
