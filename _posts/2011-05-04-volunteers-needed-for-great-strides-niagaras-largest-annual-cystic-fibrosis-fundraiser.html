<p>The Hamilton and Niagara chapters of Cystic Fibrosis Canada are still looking for additional volunteers to help out with the Great Strides walk, which will be held at Safari Niagara on Sunday May 29 2011.</p>
<p>People are still needed to do the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>General greeting</li>
<li>Registration desk</li>
<li>Wrist band handouts</li>
<li>Goodie bag handouts</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in helping out, drop me an email at toddhdow [at] gmail [dot] com and I'll put you in touch with the right people.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
