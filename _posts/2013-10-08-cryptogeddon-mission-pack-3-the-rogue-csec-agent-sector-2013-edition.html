<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-198" alt="Mission Cover - Mission Pack 3" src="assets/mission-cover-mission-pack-31.png?w=187" width="187" height="300" />Created for and presented at <a title="Sector.ca - Canada's Premier IT Security Conference" href="http://sector.ca/" target="_blank">SecTor 2013</a> (Canada's Premier IT Security Conference), Cryptogeddon Sector 2013 Edition offers Cryptogeddon's most involved infosec mission yet.</p>
<p>A  Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) cybersecurity analyst has gone rogue. He has taken a large cache of top secret files that include the names and identities of several secret agents working in foreign countries. This rogue analyst has stowed these files on the internet in an encrypted format and he is now threatening to share the location of the files and the decryption keys with the public.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the CSEC cybersecurity analyst narrowly avoided capture at a local cyber cafe, but during his escape, he left behind a USB drive, which contained our only clues thus far:</p>
<ul>
<li>files.zip</li>
</ul>
<p>We suspect that he was using the files on the USB drive to access his online data store.</p>
<p>Your assignment is to use the contents of the USB drive to recover the data cache and provide us with an inventory of the agent identities so that we can extract those agents before they are harmed.</p>
<p>NOTE: This mission requires the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 and this mission is compatible with <a title="Amazon Web Services Free Tier" href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services' Free Tier</a>.</p>
