<em>3:30pm - “Keynote: How hackers operate: Live demonstrations of current methods of breaching networks and stealing information”, by <a title="Derrick Webber" href="http://congress.scmagazine.com/page.cfm/Action=Visitor/VisitorID=65">Derrick Webber</a>, penetration testing and digital forensics team lead, CGI</em></p>
<p>Derrick demonstrated some practical applications of the <a title="Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)" href="https://www.trustedsec.com/downloads/social-engineer-toolkit/">Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)</a>. He demonstrated how to conduct a phishing attack to obtain user login credentials for banking, Google and other sites. In a nutshell, here were the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use SET to build a clone of a production website (the site looks the same, only it uses a different URL - wwwgoogle.com.cn for example)</li>
<li>Use SET to send a phishing email to your target, hoping that they will click the link to your clone website;</li>
<li>The target goes to the clone website and attempts to log in. At that point, the credentials are captured and the user is redirected to the legitimate website;</li>
<li>The user then logs in to the legitimate website, usually none the wiser that they just gave up their credentials to the bad guys;</li>
</ol>
<p>Derrick mentioned using the <a title="Google Hacking Database" href="http://www.exploit-db.com/google-dorks/">Google Hacking Database</a> to identify data that Google has crawled and would be useful in an exploit. It really is unbelievable how much publically available content is available - and Google has done a great job of indexing it and sharing it if you know how to search for it. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>inurl:"/root/etc/passwd" intext:"home/*:" - this will identify publically accessible password files;</li>
<li>filetype:ini "This is the default settings file for new PHP installations" - these files contain info that could help you compromise a web server;</li>
<li>site*.*.*/webalizer intitle:"Usage Statistics" - log files, anyone?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Derrick demonstrated using <a title="Metasploit" href="http://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit</a> to build a trojan, obfuscate attach it to the back of a legitimate exe file (think winword.exe, notepad.exe, etc.) and then deliver the file to an unsuspecting target.</p>
<p>Derrick shared a great slide on preventing exfiltration of data from hackers. It suggested using proxies, block ports, etc. I haven’t seen the slides online yet, but if I find them, I will link to them from here.</p>
<p>Overall, this was an awesome presentation!</p>
