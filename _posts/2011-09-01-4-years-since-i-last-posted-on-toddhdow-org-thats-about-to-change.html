<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddhdow/6101420805/"><img class="alignright" title="Dow Family 2011" src="assets/6101420805_a9d29204e0.jpg" alt="Dow Family 2011" width="375" height="500" /></a>Folks,</p>
<p>I can't believe that this blog has been collecting dust for almost 4 years! Who knew that growing a new family from scratch would be so disruptive to one's priorities in life? So, for those that think I've been taking it easy for the last 4 years, I'm including a picture that shows you the project I call "family" that I've been cultivating for the last few years.</p>
<p>Regardless, I've been away for a while, and I'm getting antsy to write some new content. There are plenty of ideas percolating in my head. So, just an FYI that I will be writing some new, fresh content here shortly. I have a few ideas brewing in my head and I am currently putting some stuff down on paper. What kind of things, you ask? Well, here's a sneak preview of some topics that I'm working through right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recently passed my PMP exam. I'll post my experience preparing for the exam;</li>
<li>I recently read an <a title="Iâ€™m glad I never had to decide whether my strange, lonely boy ought to exist " href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/ian-brown/im-glad-i-never-had-to-decide-whether-my-strange-lonely-boy-ought-to-exist/article2144132/singlepage/#articlecontent" target="_blank">article in the Globe &amp; Mail</a> that discusses genetic testing and its impact on the value of a life and the pro-choice discussion. The article specifically mentions Cystic Fibrosis. CF is a disease that is <a title="Breathing As A Family - About Us" href="http://breathingasafamily.org/about/" target="_blank">very personal to me</a>, so, I'll be wading into the bioethics, abortion and the pro-life / pro-choice discussion and offering my thoughts &amp; views;</li>
<li>And, I'm writing longer stuff. I'm considering publishing something in the near future. So I'll be providing updates on that, along with some commentary on the publishing world. You can expect to read stuff pertaining to <a title="Amazon Kindle" href="https://kindle.amazon.com/" target="_blank">amazon kindle</a>, <a title="Kobo" href="http://kobobooks.com/" target="_blank">kobo</a>, <a title="GoodReads" href="http://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">goodreads</a> and a bunch of other bookish topics;</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah... Feel free to <a title="toddhdow.org - archive" href="http://toddhdow.org/archive/" target="_blank">peruse my existing site content</a>. I'm surprised by how much traffic the existing content on this site still gets.</p>
<p>And, please do <a title="Subscribe to toddhdow.org" href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=toddhdow&amp;loc=en_US" target="_blank">subscribe to my posts</a> or check back often to keep up to date!</p>
