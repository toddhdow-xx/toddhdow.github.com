<p>Folks,</p></div>
<p>As I'm sure you've noticed, I haven't written on this blog for a while. Life has been busy: 3 kids, a new house, a new job, etc. I will write here again in the future. But, in the meantime, I'm dedicating most of my online writing to another blog called breathingasafamily.org.</p>
<p>What is Breathing As A Family? It is our family blog, detailing the challenges of dealing with Cystic Fibrosis. Our daughter Katie was diagnosed with CF and this blog is a document to our experience dealing with this disease.</p>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis, or CF, affects the lungs and the digestive system. CF is the most common, fatal, genetic disease affecting Canadian children and young adults. Forty years ago, most children with CF did not live long enough to attend kindergarten. Today, half of Canadians with CF will still not live into their 40s.</p>
<p>Here's a video that provides a snapshot into Katie's life:<br />

<p>So, while you await the day when I start blogging on this site again, please do direct your attention to breathingasafamily.org.</p>
<p>Thanks and talk soon!</p>
