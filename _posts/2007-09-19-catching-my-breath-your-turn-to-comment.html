<p>I'm taking a rest day today to catch my breath and to get caught up on some other items that are currently outstanding. That being said, today is not a total wash... I've got a challenge for you today. Read on for more...</p>
<p>But first, I'm really excited by this latest series on Dawkins' The God Delusion. Your feedback has been great. I appreciate both positive and negative comments. Positive comments encourage me. The challenging comments force me to strengthen my writing (and they keep me on my toes!). Thank you to everyone that's commented thus far.</p>
<p>Now, for the fun part... This is your chance to get involved!</p>
<p>I'd like to get your thoughts and opinions on what you've read so far. I don't want to interrupt this series by responding to comments in the middle, but I am eager to respond to some of the feedback that I've received. So, once I've completed this series, I'll take a couple of days (give or take, depending on the feedback I get) to respond to questions and to discuss this topic in more detail.</p>
<p>So... there are a couple of ways you can participate:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can provide a comment (or two... or more!) to any of the posts in this series; or</li>
<li>You can email me directly (toddhdow [at] gmail.com);</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll take a sampling of these comments and build them into Q &amp; A type posts at the tail end of this series. Should make for some fun discussions as I'm sure that we're not all in complete agreement on any of this stuff. But, that doesn't mean that we can't have a positive dialogue.</p>
<p>One request: please do not use profanity or offensive language in your posts. I don't want to censor any content, but I do want to keep the content respectful. I don't blush at the odd swear word, but swearing, name calling, threats, etc. will result in comments either being modified or deleted completely.</p>
<p>Thanks and I look forward to your thoughts!</p>
<p>Todd Dow</p>
