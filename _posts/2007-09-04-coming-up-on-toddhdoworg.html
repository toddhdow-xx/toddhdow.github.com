<p>So... I finally finished reading "The God Delusion" by Richard Dawkins. I'm a bit disappointed by the book. Yes, I'm obviously biased, but I did try to keep an open mind about the book. I must say that even though I kept an open mind, I still had a hard time being convinced by him. He did raise some good points about the overzealous nature of some religious practitioners, but I felt that he stereotyped and assumed too much about religious people as a whole. As well, his attitude was far too condescending and self-righteous for his own good. And, I felt that some of his arguments were just plain weak. I'm glad that I read the book though, because now I can make an informed opinion about his writing.</p>
<p>Watch for my full review coming up in the next few days. It'll be a multi-part review.</p>
<p>Next on the agenda though will be sharing a sermon that I presented this past weekend at my home church. The topic is the importance of family. I'll be posting it over a number of days. Give it a read and let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>And I'd like to thank those of you that have written to me recently telling me that you've enjoyed my posts. Your comments have been extremely motivating.</p>
<p>Thanks again and God Bless!</p>
