<p>I was reading the following article tonight and it prompted me to write:</p>
<p><a target="end1" href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/praying_for_the_apocalypse/">Praying for the Apocalypse</a></p>
<p>People have been claiming that the end is sight ever since... well... since people could say those words. I still find it surprising though that people actually bank on that kind of a worldview. From global warming to nuclear war, the pessimists out there have been calling out like Chicken Little for as long as I can remember. I find this disappointing, because, while I do have the occasional negative day, I don't sit and dwell on the end times at the expense of living in the present.</p>
<p>Last time I remember, Jesus gave us instructions to stick around and to live our lives according to God's rules. We weren't to pack up and wait for Jesus to come back. Some instructions:</p>
<dd>
<dl>"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [...] And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.'" (Matt 22:37-40)</dl>
<dl>"I am going to send you what my Father has promised, but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high." (Luke 24:49)</dl>
</dd>
<p>I could quote numerous other passages, but the point is this: Jesus directs us to live according to his principles in the world. As we read in John (John 17:14-19), we are in the world but not of the world. We are all visitors here on Earth and we are here for a brief amount of time. As visitors, should we foster a positive or a negative perspective towards others?</p>
<p>Church history is full of urgent appeals based on the understanding that the end is near. Unfortunately, these battle-plagued end times scenarios have never turned out well for anyone. The end times have yet to arrive for the persecutors, and the persecuted suffer as a result. And, more importantly, the persecutors that once demonized the targets of their aggression end up looking like the demonizers. This begs the question: "Who is the real demon in all of this?"</p>
<p>We have a responsibility to live responsibly under the guidance and spiritual presence of God. We, as Christians, have moral obligations to love our neighbours and to make the world a better place. Even those that are not Christian agree that our moral compasses are fairly well aligned when it comes to good and evil.</p>
<p>Be on guard against temptations to become a demon in the name of religion. Be responsible and follow Jesus' calling to wait out his return in loving and caring fashion. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be caught compromising my values in the name of religious justification. And raising our hands in violence in the name of Christ would definitely be compromising those values.</p>
