<p>My name is Todd and my daughter Katie (who is now 2 years old) has Cystic Fibrosis. My wife Julie and I learned of this diagnosis on Tuesday September 30 2008. Julie knew before I did – mother’s intuition, I guess. I lived in denial until the medical diagnosis had been delivered to us on that fateful day. Katie’s older brother, Noah – three and a half years old – understands that Katie has CF, but he doesn’t yet grasp the full impact of what this means for our family.</p>
<p>Our family has changed since that late September day. This blog is a chronicle of these changes. Not sure where this conversation will go yet. As with everything in the future, only time will tell.</p>
<p>We’ve aptly titled this blog, “Breathing as a family”, as CF doesn’t only affect Katie – it affects all of us, as a family. And, as a family, we have learned, and will continue to learn, how to live with this disease together.</p>
<p>We invite you to share this journey with us. Our goals for this blog are fourfold. It provides a place for:<br />1. us to share our hopes, joys, celebrations, frustrations, sadness and everything in between;<br />2. our family and friends to keep up to date on what’s going on with us;<br />3. others to share and learn – especially other families that are living with Cystic Fibrosis; and<br />4. raising awareness, fundraising and building community;</p>
<p>So please, visit often. Feel free to comment and share in the discussion.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting and talk soon!</p>
<p>Todd, Julie, Noah and Katie</p>
