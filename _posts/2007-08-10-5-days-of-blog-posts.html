<p>Starting on Monday, I'm going to outline 5 different types of Blog Posts that you can utilize in your blog. I don't claim to have a monopoly on all of the different types of blog posts, but I'm sure that this list will provide you with a great starting point and plenty of great ideas to continue to build your blog's content.</p>
<p>Over the next week, I'll be covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
