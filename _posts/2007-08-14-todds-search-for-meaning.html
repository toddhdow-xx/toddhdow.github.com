<p>I thought I'd take a few days to give a bit of biographical detail on my religious walk. I'll take the next few days to give some commentary on the following topics:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>My background</strong> - Where I come from, what prompted my search, my ambitions, etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/2007/08/15/maintaining-my-faith-as-a-philosophy-undergrad-student/"><strong>Maintaining My Faith as a Philosophy Undergrad Student</strong></a> - this isn't as easy as it sounds!</li>

</ol>
<p>Today, I'll talk a bit about my background and what prompted me to become so strong in my faith.</p>
<p>I grew up in a Christian home and I went to chuch when I was little. But religion was never pushed on me as a child. I was given the choice to pursue my faith as I grew older. For a while in my teen years, I drifted away from the church. As I moved into my 20s and started to think about settling down and getting married, I started thinking about the importance of church in family life. I always had this idea that I would like to get back in tune with God, but it wasn't until I got married that I found my way back. My wife, Julie, is a strong Christian and she became my catalyst for coming back to Church. We were married in her home church. I was baptized in that church about a year after we got married (there was no peer pressure from my wife - it was my choice.) I became comfortable going to church again as a result of these activities.</p>
<p>That's all fine and good, but why the strong attraction to religion? Plenty of people find themselves going to church as a family. That doesn't mean that they go and sign up for divinity school and have ambitions of becoming a pastor. What prompted my desire to become so closely aligned with God?</p>
<p>Well... around my mid-twenties, I started working on my undergrad degree part time at the University of Toronto. I was working full time and I wanted to finish my degree to further my career and also for the personal benefits of additional education. And, I was experiencing a reawakening of my faith, so I thought what better topic to study than my belief in God and my interest in Chrisitanity. So, I enrolled in a specialist program in philosophy and religious studies.</p>
<p>This was just what I needed: the chance to learn more about my faith from experts in the field. Little did I know when I enrolled that this program that many of the thoughts that I would run into during this time would challenge the established views of the church. I'll speak more on this next time though. I don't want to get ahead of myself.</p>
<p>My goal during my undergrad was to firmly establish my faith and to learn how to intelligently articulate my faith to others. I wasn't happy to just say that I believed because that's what I was taught in Sunday school as a kid. I needed to be able to understand and explain my faith to others in a way that made sense.</p>
<p>And, I also used my undergrad years to temper my faith. I quietly researched potential career options in ministry during my undergrad years, but I kept I pretty quiet as I wanted to see just how serious I was and I wanted to make sure that my interest in Christian ministry wasn't just a short term fad.</p>
<p>Well, I'm well into my graduate degree, and there are no signs of waning passion for ministry. So... looks like my faith has survived so far.</p>
<p>Stay tuned! Next time, we'll discuss <a href="http://toddhdow.wordpress.com/2007/08/15/maintaining-my-faith-as-a-philosophy-undergrad-student/"><strong>Maintaining My Faith as a Philosophy Undergrad Student</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Talk soon!</p>
