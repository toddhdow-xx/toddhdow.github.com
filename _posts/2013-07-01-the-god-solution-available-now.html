<p>It's official! My first published book is <a title="The God Solution To The Atheist Delusion on amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Solution-Atheist-Delusion-ebook/dp/B00DQ8L174" target="_blank">now available for purchase</a>.</p>
<p>The book is now available as an ebook and you can read it on your Kindle or on the Kindle Reader, which works on pretty much every device out there (ipod, iphone, android, etc.).</p>
<p>In 2008, Richard Dawkins wrote a book called “The God Delusion”. The book offered a controversial critique of belief in God. I felt that his critique was flawed on numerous fronts. This book is a summary of my thoughts and a defence of my faith.</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins’ book, The God Delusion, has become a go to source for Atheists when they attempt to dispel the validity of religion. Unfortunately, Dawkins’ arguments are flawed. In this thought provoking book, Todd Dow refutes The God Delusion through a thorough analysis of Dawkins’ arguments. Chapter by chapter, I pinpoint the issues with Dawkins’ arguments, outlining the flaws in Dawkins’ logic and offering valid and sound responses to each of the issues that Dawkins addresses.</p>
<p>The following topics are addressed:<br />
Straw Men – Dawkins’ weak proofs of God<br />
The Ultimate 747 – Is that the best he’s got?<br />
Problems with Organized Religion<br />
The objective roots of morality<br />
The Historical Jesus<br />
The problem with fundamentalism<br />
The slippery slope of abortion<br />
Why not rid ourselves of religion, politics and economics?<br />
Childhood abuse and brainwashing<br />
On evolution and concluding thoughts</p>
<p>And, as an added bonus, I have included an appendix that contains a thought experiment entitled, “Should Atheists Have Children?”</p>
<p>Please do go <a title="The God Solution To The Atheist Delusion on amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Solution-Atheist-Delusion-ebook/dp/B00DQ8L174" target="_blank">pick up a copy of my book</a> and let me know what you think - feel free to offer your feedback in the comments below and (more importantly) provide your feedback on my book page on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
