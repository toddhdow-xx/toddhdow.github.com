<p>Folks,</p>
<p>Just wanted to remind you that May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month. Please do your best to help raise awareness to help fight CF. I'm personally raising awareness by blogging, fundraising and participating in the Great Strides walk on Sunday May 30 2010 at Safari Niagara in Stevensville Ontario.</p>
<p>What are you doing to help raise awareness and to help fight CF? Drop your comments below. And, send others to this site as well.</p>
<p>I haven't posted much over the last month. That's gonna change for May. I'm putting the finishing touches on a series of posts, entitled, "Cystic Diagnosis". In this series, I'll be sharing our personal diagnosis story. When we found out that Katie had CF. The process that took place to verify things. How we responded. etc.</p>
<p>And, I'm also going to fit in a post series on bioethics. As many of you are aware, we're expecting our third child. Our daughter has CF. That means that Julie and I are both carriers. That means that Dow baby #3 has a 1 in 4 chance of having CF. Plenty of thought went into the decision to have a third child. We'll share a bit of our thinking on that one. And, Dow Baby #3 is due this month (due date = May 27 2010). So... this bioethics series will be especially timely.</p>
<p>Thanks and stay tuned!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
