<p>I just want to say thank you to the many people who have donated or signed up to walk with us on Sunday May 30 2010. You have been very generous and we appreciate all of the love and support.</p>
<p>And, I'd like to share a recent blog post that very succinctly summarizes the video as "a prayer": <a href="http://thefirstmennonitechurch.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/choices-in-iworld/" target="new1">http://thefirstmennonitechurch.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/choices-in-iworld/</a></p>
<p>Thanks Carol for helping to share our message and for recognizing it as such.</p>
<p>Talk soon!</p>
<p>Todd</p>
