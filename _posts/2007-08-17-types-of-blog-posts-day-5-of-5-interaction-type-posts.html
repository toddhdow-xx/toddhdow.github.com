<p>In this 5 part series, we're examining <a href="http://wirepaper.com/2007/08/10/5-days-of-blog-posts/">5 Different Types of Blog Posts</a>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/red_5of5.png" alt="Post 5 of 5 (red)" align="left" />Question: What's one of the best ways to build rapport with your audience?</p>
<p>Answer: To engage your audience in a dialogue. And the primary way of doing this is asking or answering questions. I've used this method a few times and it works wonders. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>When readers ask questions, they have a vested interest in watching for a response.</li>
<li>When readers ask questions, you know that they are reading your content and that they want to engage in conversation with you.</li>
<li>When you answer reader questions, you are providing content that is in demand.</li>
<li>When you answer reader questions, you are telling your readers that you care about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps to build a sense of community around your blog. Community is so important. Few people last long simply sitting and listening to a lecture. The best teachers I've ever had have invited discussion, whether in the form of questions, comments or personal observations. It is this give and take between the participants that leads to growth in your audience.</p>
<p>Question-type posts are just that: You ask your readers to submit questions that they would like you to address in future posts. This is a great way to build a posting schedule for the near future if you're unsure about what to write about. And, it's also a great way to keep your readers coming back on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Answer-type posts are the follow up to the question-type posts (pretty obvious stuff). These are especially good when you provide links to the people that posed the questions. Everybody likes to see their names mentioned in print. Mentioning them at the beginning of this type of post immediately bumps your blog to the top of their favourites list for a while! Keep that in mind when trying to build community with your readers.</p>
<p>And, whether you use all of the questions or not in your blog posts, be sure to respond to every suggestion in some way. Remember, you're building relationships with your visitors. Write them back. Thank them for their submissions. If you're going to use their questions, great. Give them some sort of idea when you'll be addressing their questions. And if you don't use their questions, it's probably a good idea to let them know why. After all, they did take the time to write to you.</p>
<p>So... to properly wrap up this post, I guess I should ask a question. Here goes:</p>
