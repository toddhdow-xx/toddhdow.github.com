    buddy, I just wanted to thank-you for the time you put into this site. I am looking
    at pursuing A P.A position here and am beginning to wade through the volumes of
    info (and requirements). I am rather relieved that there is a reasonably priced
    option and that PM Prepcast is up to date with version 5(something that I was
    concerned about). Anyway, I'm just getting rolling on this so I'll give you a
    shout after the interview process and give you an update.  I just wanted to say
    Hi and thanks.\r\nScott.\";}"
